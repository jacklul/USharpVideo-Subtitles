## Features
- Subtitle synchronization with everyone in the instance
- Option to use own subtitles locally
- Rich customization with the ability for the players to save their settings
- Full integration with **USharpVideo**

## Requirements
- Unity 2019.4.29f1+
- [UdonSharp](https://github.com/vrchat-community/UdonSharp) v0.20.3+
- [USharpVideo](https://github.com/MerlinVR/USharpVideo) v1.0.0+

## Installation
1. Install [UdonSharp](https://github.com/vrchat-community/UdonSharp) first if you haven't already
2. Import [USharpVideo](https://github.com/MerlinVR/USharpVideo/releases/latest) package if you haven't already
3. Import [latest release](https://github.com/jacklul/USharpVideo-Subtitles/releases/latest) package
4. Drag the `Subtitles` prefab into your scene
    - when using **USharpVideo** - set the same transform values to make it match the position
5. When a window asking you to import **TextMeshPro Essentials** appears - just do it
6. Add a reference in the `USharpVideoSubtitles` object (**SubtitleManager** script) to:
    - when using **USharpVideo** - **USharpVideoPlayer** script (**Target Video Player** field)
    - in any other case - **VRCUnityVideoPlayer** or **VRCAVProVideoPlayer** (**Base Video Player** field) - depends on which one you're using ([you can change this dynamically](https://github.com/jacklul/USharpVideo-Subtitles#subtitlemanagersetvideoplayer-basevrcvideoplayer))
7. Add a reference in the `Subtitles/Overlay` object (**Video Screen** field) to the video player's screen object, the overlay will copy the position and rotation of the screen on world initialisation
    - if this doesn't work for you then drag `Subtitles/Overlay` object into the video player's screen object and then reset transform values on it

- When using **USharpVideo** - only the player who can control the video player can do this (`USharpVideo.CanControlVideoPlayer()`)
- For other video players - if `IsLocked()` is `true` then only the Master can do this

### SubtitleManager.IsLocked(): bool

Whenever the access is locked to Master only

- When using **USharpVideo** it shares the same state with the video player

### SubtitleManager.SetLocked(bool): void

Change lock state, must be executed by the Master

- Does nothing when used with **USharpVideo** as it shares the same state with it

### SubtitleManager.IsLocal(): bool

Whenever the player is using local subtitles

### SubtitleManager.SetLocal(bool): void

### SubtitleManager.SynchronizeSubtitles(): void

Re-synchronizes the subtitles globally, only the person who loaded them can do this - this can change when that person leaves the instance though - check the `SubtitleManager.gameObject` owner in this case

### SubtitleOverlayHandler.MoveOverlay(GameObject): void

Moves the overlay to the given object's transform values

### SubtitleOverlayHandler.ResetTransform(): void

Resets the overlay's transform to the default values (just how it was placed in Unity)

### SubtitleOverlayHandler.GetCanvasTransform(): Transform

Use this method to get transform values of the overlay's `Canvas` in case you want to display something on the same screen

### SubtitleControlHandler.ImportSettingsFromString(string): void
