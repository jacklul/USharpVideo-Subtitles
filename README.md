## Installation
1. Install [UdonSharp](https://github.com/vrchat-community/UdonSharp) first if you haven't already
2. Import [USharpVideo](https://github.com/MerlinVR/USharpVideo/releases/latest) package if you haven't already

4. Drag the `USharpVideoSubtitles/Subtitles` prefab into your scene:
    - when using **USharpVideo** - drag the prefab directly into it
    - otherwise - just drag it into the scene (preferrably at the root)
5. When a window asking you to import **TextMeshPro Essentials** appears - just do it
6. Add a reference in the `Subtitles` object (**SubtitleManager** script) to:
    - (when using **USharpVideo**) **USharpVideoPlayer** script (**Target Video Player** field)
    OR
    - **VRCUnityVideoPlayer** or **VRCAVProVideoPlayer** (**Base Video Player** field) - depends on which one you're using, usually it's the first one
7. To display subtitles in the correct position you have to drag `Subtitles/Overlay` object into the video player's screen object and then reset transform values on it.
