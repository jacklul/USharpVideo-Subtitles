# Subtitles support for USharpVideo

This prefab adds support for SRT subtitles to [USharpVideo](https://github.com/MerlinVR/USharpVideo) - it will also work with base video players supported by VRChat (Unity and AVPro).  
To check this out in-game visit [this test world](https://vrchat.com/home/world/wrld_dc50af39-1f65-4c47-a0d5-d1729d5c683f).  

_The core of this prefab is based on [this code](https://gist.github.com/hai-vr/b340f9a46952640f81efe7f02da6bdf6) by [Ha√Ø~](https://twitter.com/vr_hai)._

- [VRChat SDK 3.6.1](https://creators.vrchat.com/releases/release-3-6-1/)+

- Project created using [Creator Companion](https://vcc.docs.vrchat.com/)

## Installation

> [!TIP]
> I suggest adding "**subtitles**" to your world's tags when using this prefab so that people can find worlds with subtitle support more easily.

1. Import [USharpVideo](https://github.com/MerlinVR/USharpVideo/releases/latest)
    - **This is required even if you're not planning on using it**

2. Import [latest release](https://github.com/jacklul/USharpVideo-Subtitles/releases/latest) unitypackage

3. Drag the `Subtitles` prefab into your scene
    - _when using **USharpVideo** you can also drag `Subtitles` prefab into `USharpVideo` in your scene and reset `Subtitles` object's transform values_

4. When a window asking you to import **TextMeshPro Essentials** appears - just do it

5. Add a reference in the `Subtitles` object (**SubtitleManager** script) to:
    - when using **USharpVideo** (**Target Video Player** field) - **USharpVideoPlayer** from the `USharpVideo` object
    - in any other case (**Base Video Player** field) - **VRCUnityVideoPlayer** or **VRCAVProVideoPlayer** that have to be somewhere in your scene - depends on which one you're using ([you can change this dynamically](#subtitlemanagersetvideoplayerbasevrcvideoplayer-void))

6. Add a reference in the `Subtitles/Overlay` object (**Video Screen** field) to the video player's screen object, the overlay will copy the position and rotation of the screen on start
    - if this doesn't work on your world then you will have to manually adjust `Subtitles/Overlay` object's position and rotation to match the video screen object (while keeping the mentioned earlier field empty)

### SubtitleManager.SetVideoPlayer(BaseVRCVideoPlayer): void

Use this to change the video player reference that the subtitles are synced with

- Does nothing when using **USharpVideo**

### SubtitleManager.HasSubtitles(): bool

Check whenever subtitles are currently loaded

- It will return `true` if subtitles are loaded for the current mode (`IsLocal()`)

### SubtitleManager.ProcessInput(string): void

Loads subtitles from the text string globally or locally (depending on `IsLocal()` value)

- When using **USharpVideo** - only the player who can control the video player can do this
- For other video players - if `IsLocked()` is `true` then only the Master can do this
- To check whenever player is able to execute this - use `SubtitleManager.CanControlSubtitles()`

### SubtitleManager.ProcessURLInput(VRCUrl): void

Loads subtitles from the URL globally or locally (depending on `IsLocal()` value)

- When using **USharpVideo** - only the player who can control the video player can do this
- For other video players - if `IsLocked()` is `true` then only the Master can do this
- To check whenever player is able to execute this - use `SubtitleManager.CanControlSubtitles()`

### SubtitleManager.ClearSubtitles(): void

Clears the subtitles globally or locally (depending on `IsLocal()` value)

- When using **USharpVideo** - only the player who can control the video player can do this
- For other video players - if `IsLocked()` is `true` then only the Master can do this
- To check whenever player is able to execute this - use `SubtitleManager.CanControlSubtitles()`

### SubtitleManager.IsLocked(): bool

Whenever the access is locked to Master only

- When using **USharpVideo** it shares the same state with it

### SubtitleManager.SetLocked(bool): void

Change lock state, must be executed by the Master

- Does nothing when used with **USharpVideo** as it shares the same state with it
- This can fail if the synchronization is ongoing - check if `SubtitleManager.IsSynchronized()` is `true` before running it
- To check whenever player is able to execute this - use `SubtitleManager.IsPrivilegedUser(VRCPlayerApi)`

### SubtitleManager.IsEnabled(): bool

Whenever the subtitles are enabled for the the player

### SubtitleManager.SetEnabled(bool): void

Enable or disable the subtitles for the the player

### SubtitleManager.IsLocal(): bool

Whenever the player is using local subtitles

### SubtitleManager.SetLocal(bool): void

Switch between using global and local subtitles

### SubtitleManager.IsSyncedURL(): bool

Check if URL was synced or not, make sure to also check if `SubtitleManager.IsSynchronized()` is `true`

- If this is false and `SubtitleManager.IsSynchronized()` is `true` then subtitles from pasted text are used

### SubtitleManager.ReloadSyncedURL(): bool

Reload data from synced URL, can be used to retry failed requests

- This is done locally, anyone can call this

### SubtitleManager.SynchronizeSubtitles(): void

Re-synchronizes the subtitles globally, only the person who loaded them can do this (or the master if the synchronization is finished) - this can change when that person leaves the instance or lock state changes - check the `SubtitleManager.gameObject` owner in this case

- This can fail if the synchronization is ongoing - check if `SubtitleManager.IsSynchronized()` is `true` before running it
- To check whenever player is able to execute this - use `SubtitleManager.CanSynchronizeSubtitles()`

### SubtitleOverlayHandler.GetCanvasTransform(): Transform

Use this method to get transform values of the overlay's `Canvas` in case you want to display something on the same screen

### SubtitleOverlayHandler.MoveOverlay(GameObject): void

Moves the overlay to the given object's transform values

- Make sure that the settings popup is not visible at this time as it will stay in the old position until it is re-opened

### SubtitleControlHandler.IsSettingsPopupActive(): bool

Check if settings popup is currently open

### SubtitleControlHandler.ToggleSettingsPopup(): void

Toggle settings popup, use this to show and hide the popup using separate button

### SubtitleControlHandler.ImportSettingsFromString(string): void

Import settings from the given string (the same string which is displayed in the settings window), the format is pretty easy to figure out
