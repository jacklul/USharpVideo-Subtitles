    00:00:39,626 --> 00:00:41,617

    Is it supposed to be
    doing that?



    2

    00:00:41,706 --> 00:00:45,824

    It''s a coronal
    mass emission,

    like a giant solar flare.



    3

    00:00:46,266 -->
    00:00:49,781

    - But it''s safe, right?

    - That''s what this equipment
    will find out.



    4

    00:00:49,866 --> 00:00:55,259

    Apart from disrupting
    the magnetic field,

    it might cause an increase in radiation.



    5

    00:00:55,346
    --> 00:00:57,223

    But it''s safe, right?



    6

    00:00:57,306 --> 00:01:00,582

    As
    long as we don''t

    stay here too long, yes, sir.



    7

    00:01:00,666
    --> 00:01:03,055

    Anyone explain that to Daniel?



    8

    00:01:10,266
    --> 00:01:12,939

    I''ve encountered this script before.



    9

    00:01:13,026
    --> 00:01:18,020

    It''s, uh, similar in pronunciation to

    a language
    on our planet called Latin.



    10

    00:01:20,386 --> 00:01:24,299

    As
    near as I can tell, the main body of

    the text represents a planetary history.



    11

    00:01:24,386
    --> 00:01:28,937

    I agree... But isn''t it time for you

    to return through
    the Stargate?



    12

    00:01:29,026 --> 00:01:34,225

    I don''t understand
    the significance of

    what this is. A sort of control mechanism.



    13

    00:01:34,866
    --> 00:01:39,815

    It''s obviously still in working order.

    I wonder if
    that''s... significant.



    14

    00:01:40,786 --> 00:01:44,779

    The
    storm is approaching, Dr Jackson.

    The radiation may be dangerous for you.



    15

    00:01:44,866
    --> 00:01:47,824

    Oh, yes. Major Carter will let us

    know when we have
    to leave.



    16

    00:01:47,906 --> 00:01:53,264

    Now, this line recurs
    several times:

    ''''Domavatus vestul motabilum.''''



    17

    00:01:54,466
    --> 00:01:56,343

    ''''Conqueror of time.''''



    18

    00:01:56,426
    --> 00:01:59,941

    In this context, I''d say more like

    ''''Master of
    the uncertain past.''''



    19

    00:02:00,026 --> 00:02:03,018

    - You''re
    a skilled linguist, Dr Jackson.

    - Thank you.



    20

    00:02:03,106
    --> 00:02:06,815

    I had the opportunity to hear the language

    spoken
    a year or so ago, so...



    21

    00:02:06,906 --> 00:02:08,897

    (high-pitched
    sound)



    22

    00:02:10,146 --> 00:02:11,465

    What''s that?



    23

    00:02:11,546
    --> 00:02:15,824

    The geomagnetic disturbance

    is reaching its peak.
    I have to act now.



    24

    00:02:19,266 --> 00:02:20,745

    I don''t
    understand.



    25

    00:02:52,306 --> 00:02:54,342

    - All set up, sir.

    -
    Good.



    26

    00:02:54,986 --> 00:02:56,817

    Let''s hit it.



    27

    00:02:56,906
    --> 00:02:59,215

    Daniel, let''s go home.



    28

    00:03:04,066 -->
    00:03:05,294

    Daniel?



    29

    00:03:07,466 --> 00:03:09,138

    (electricity
    crackling)



    30

    00:03:13,906 --> 00:03:17,216

    - O''Neill.

    -
    Yeah, I hear it.



    31

    00:03:33,746 --> 00:03:36,340

    Incoming wormhole.



    32

    00:03:41,506
    --> 00:03:43,144

    What is that?



    33

    00:03:43,786 --> 00:03:45,583

    I
    have no idea, sir.



    34

    00:03:50,786 --> 00:03:52,663

    Are you
    doin'' this?



    35

    00:03:52,906 --> 00:03:55,864

    - Stay away!

    -
    What the hell are you doing?



    36

    00:03:56,266 --> 00:03:58,257

    Stay
    back!



    37

    00:04:02,946 --> 00:04:04,265

    Colonel!



    38

    00:04:07,106
    --> 00:04:10,701

    Anyway, I''m sorry, but that just

    happens to be how
    I feel about it.



    39

    00:04:10,786 --> 00:04:13,175

    What do you
    think?



    40

    00:04:19,466 --> 00:04:21,457

    What?



    41

    00:04:24,146
    --> 00:04:26,899

    What do you think?



    42

    00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:32,178

    Colonel?
    ls something wrong?



    43

    00:04:33,386 --> 00:04:35,581

    Maybe.



    44

    00:05:42,386
    --> 00:05:44,820

    Weren''t we just somewhere else?



    45

    00:05:46,186
    --> 00:05:48,142

    - Where?

    - Some planet.



    46

    00:05:48,226
    --> 00:05:49,215

    - When?

    - Just now.



    47

    00:05:49,306 -->
    00:05:50,500

    - No.

    - Sure?



    48

    00:05:50,586 --> 00:05:52,656

    Yeah.



    49

    00:05:59,786
    --> 00:06:01,777

    Everything just changed.



    50

    00:06:01,866 -->
    00:06:05,415

    Sir, we''ve been sitting in the commissary

    for the past
    half-hour.



    51

    00:06:05,506 --> 00:06:08,942

    - Really?

    -
    You''ve gotten the two places confused.



    52

    00:06:10,906 --> 00:06:13,466

    -
    We''re gonna be late for the briefing.

    - Briefing?



    53

    00:06:15,986
    --> 00:06:20,502

    Are you OK, or are you just trying

    to avoid answering
    my question?



    54

    00:06:22,106 --> 00:06:24,301

    No, I''m fine.



    55

    00:06:26,066
    --> 00:06:28,261

    What question?



    56

    00:06:36,746 --> 00:06:42,503

    Two
    weeks ago, SG-15 took these images

    of solar activity on P4X-639.



    57

    00:06:42,586
    --> 00:06:46,420

    Analysis of the data indicates

    a steady increase in
    the intensity.



    58

    00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:49,942

    Now, if I''m
    right, the explosions

    that we''re witnessing here...



    59

    00:06:50,026
    --> 00:06:53,018

    ..are just the precursor

    to a greater violent ejection.



    60

    00:06:53,106
    --> 00:06:56,985

    Major Carter? Have we not previously

    been briefed
    concerning this matter?



    61

    00:06:57,066 --> 00:06:59,580

    - I
    was just gonna say that.

    - Sir?



    62

    00:07:01,066 --> 00:07:05,582

    You
    wanna go to the planet and set up

    some kind of remote observatory.



    63

    00:07:07,026
    --> 00:07:09,062

    - Yes.

    - We just did that.



    64

    00:07:09,306
    --> 00:07:11,501

    - No, we didn''t.

    - I believe we did.



    65

    00:07:11,586
    --> 00:07:13,542

    No, that''s what the briefing is about.



    66

    00:07:13,626
    --> 00:07:16,424

    I remember listening to Carter prattle on...



    67

    00:07:16,506
    --> 00:07:19,623

    ..about solar activity

    and a... corona something.



    68

    00:07:19,706
    --> 00:07:22,266

    Coronal mass emissions.

    I was about to bring it up.



    69

    00:07:22,346
    --> 00:07:26,464

    - There you go. How would I know that?

    - Maybe you
    read my report.



    70

    00:07:27,386 --> 00:07:29,775

    Maybe he read
    your report?



    71

    00:07:32,706 --> 00:07:35,459

    I''m tellin''
    you guys,

    we''ve done this before.



    72

    00:07:35,986 --> 00:07:37,977

    I
    am in agreement with O''Neill.



    73

    00:07:38,066 --> 00:07:42,298

    I
    am experiencing a great deal

    of familiarity with these events.



    74

    00:07:42,386
    --> 00:07:44,900

    (PA) Unscheduled offworld activation.



    75

    00:07:53,186
    --> 00:07:55,654

    We have an unscheduled

    incoming traveller, sir.



    76

    00:07:55,746
    --> 00:07:58,783

    - It''s SG-12.

    - (Hammond) They''re not due for days.



    77

    00:07:58,866
    --> 00:08:01,858

    (technician) Receiving GDO transmission.



    78

    00:08:05,106
    --> 00:08:06,937

    It''s SG-12.



    79

    00:08:10,106 --> 00:08:13,098

    -
    Open the iris.

    - One of them will be injured.



    80

    00:08:26,106
    --> 00:08:30,145

    - What do you make of all of this, Major?

    - Well,
    sir, I''m not sure.



    81

    00:08:30,226 --> 00:08:33,423

    SG-12''s
    early return

    was the result of an accident.



    82

    00:08:33,506
    --> 00:08:35,656

    One of the team fell and broke his ankle.



    83

    00:08:35,746
    --> 00:08:39,216

    How could Teal''c and Colonel O''Neill

    know that was
    going to happen?



    84

    00:08:39,306 --> 00:08:43,345

    Both of them
    claim to have memories

    of SG-1''s mission to P4X-639.



    85

    00:08:43,426
    --> 00:08:47,135

    A mission that isn''t scheduled

    to start for six hours.



    86

    00:08:55,906
    --> 00:09:00,104

    OK. So Sam was setting up instruments,

    and... where
    was l?



    87

    00:09:00,866 --> 00:09:03,505

    You were by the altar
    deal with the guy.



    88

    00:09:03,986 --> 00:09:08,025

    Right. You''re
    gonna need

    to be a little more specific.



    89

    00:09:09,546 -->
    00:09:10,820

    Malikai.



    90

    00:09:10,906 --> 00:09:15,024

    That''s
    the alien archaeologist

    SG-15 met on the first survey.



    91

    00:09:15,106
    --> 00:09:18,416

    - I was looking forward to meeting him.

    - You did.



    92

    00:09:18,506
    --> 00:09:20,815

    You got along swell.



    93

    00:09:21,946 --> 00:09:26,542

    Anyway,
    a beam shot out from the ruins

    around the altar and hit the Stargate.



    94

    00:09:27,906
    --> 00:09:30,215

    There was a blinding flash of light.



    95

    00:09:30,306
    --> 00:09:34,140

    Then I was back in the commissary

    eating my Froot
    Loops.



    96

    00:09:37,946 --> 00:09:40,540

    I can''t find anything
    wrong

    with either of them.



    97

    00:09:40,626 --> 00:09:45,177

    We''ll
    wait for the lab results to be sure,

    but they appear to be in perfect health.



    98

    00:09:45,266
    --> 00:09:48,224

    Except for remembering events

    that haven''t happened
    yet.



    99

    00:09:48,586 --> 00:09:53,182

    - But why Jack and Teal''c
    and not us?

    - I''m not takin'' any chances.



    100

    00:09:53,266
    --> 00:09:58,056

    Until we figure out what''s going on,

    I''m postponing
    your mission to P4X-639.



    101

    00:10:10,626 --> 00:10:12,821

    Jack.
    Wait up.



    102

    00:10:13,466 --> 00:10:18,745

    Um... I was thinking
    about what you said

    about, uh, a beam coming out of the altar.



    103

    00:10:18,826
    --> 00:10:22,899

    SG-15 took digital images

    of the carvings on the ruins.



    104

    00:10:23,186
    --> 00:10:25,746

    I was thinking there might be

    some sort of clue.



    105

    00:10:25,826
    --> 00:10:29,136

    Unfortunately it''s the equivalent

    of 400 pages of
    alien text.



    106

    00:10:29,226 --> 00:10:32,616

    If you give me
    details about

    the layout of the ruins...



    107

    00:10:34,666 -->
    00:10:36,941

    Gee, sorry, Dr Jackson.



    108

    00:10:38,066 --> 00:10:40,455

    Shoulda
    seen that comin''.



    109

    00:10:51,266 --> 00:10:52,221

    So...



    110

    00:10:53,066
    --> 00:10:54,215

    So?



    111

    00:10:55,746 --> 00:10:58,385

    Don''t
    you know what I''m gonna say?



    112

    00:10:58,466 --> 00:11:02,744

    Actually,
    by this time

    we were on the planet.



    113

    00:11:02,826 --> 00:11:04,737

    It''s
    all different now.



    114

    00:11:04,826 --> 00:11:05,815

    Oh.



    115

    00:11:05,906
    --> 00:11:11,026

    Well, I was thinking about what you said

    about a beam
    hitting the Stargate.



    116

    00:11:11,106 --> 00:11:13,336

    - What
    about it?

    - After the flash,...



    117

    00:11:13,426 --> 00:11:17,544

    ..you
    found yourself back here, reliving

    the moments leading up to the mission.



    118

    00:11:18,506
    --> 00:11:21,384

    Maybe you''re not

    remembering future events.



    119

    00:11:21,466
    --> 00:11:25,425

    - Maybe you were sent back in time.

    - For what? Six
    hours?



    120

    00:11:25,506 --> 00:11:30,580

    Well, it wouldn''t
    be the first time.

    The Stargate did send us back to 1969.



    121

    00:11:31,506
    --> 00:11:33,497

    Good year.



    122

    00:11:33,586 --> 00:11:39,218

    So
    could this beam be a means

    to access the gate''s subspace field...



    123

    00:11:39,306
    --> 00:11:43,697

    ..in order to create some kind of

    time inversion outside
    of subspace?



    124

    00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:51,260

    I knew you were
    gonna say that.



    125

    00:11:51,986 --> 00:11:54,341

    I guess I''m
    just thinkin'' out loud.



    126

    00:11:54,426 --> 00:11:57,020

    I''m
    gonna go run a few simulations.



    127

    00:11:58,826 --> 00:12:01,340

    You
    run... Simulate.



    128

    00:12:03,826 --> 00:12:06,818

    Let me know
    how it turns out.

    Keep me posted.



    129

    00:12:10,066 --> 00:12:12,216

    Keep
    me apprised.



    130

    00:12:18,226 --> 00:12:22,777

    The lab results
    confirm Dr Fraiser''s

    assessment. You''re both in perfect health.



    131

    00:12:24,946
    --> 00:12:28,825

    - Any more of these premonitions?

    - Not for some time.



    132

    00:12:28,906
    --> 00:12:31,420

    Can we go back to work, General, please?



    133

    00:12:31,506
    --> 00:12:33,861

    I have no objection, as long as...



    134

    00:12:33,946
    --> 00:12:36,460

    (PA) Unscheduled offworld activation.



    135

    00:12:38,906
    --> 00:12:40,897

    D''oh!



    136

    00:12:51,346 --> 00:12:53,337

    What
    is that?



    137

    00:12:53,426 --> 00:12:56,702

    I''m not sure, sir.

    I''ve
    never seen anything like it.



    138

    00:12:56,786 --> 00:12:58,777

    We
    have.



    139

    00:13:00,066 --> 00:13:03,661

    Anyway, I''m sorry,
    but that just

    happens to be how I feel about it.



    140

    00:13:03,746
    --> 00:13:06,135

    What do you think?



    141

    00:13:11,786 --> 00:13:14,380

    Colonel?
    ls something wrong?



    142

    00:13:15,346 --> 00:13:17,496

    Oh, yeah.



    143

    00:13:17,586
    --> 00:13:19,577

    Somethin''.



    144

    00:13:22,866 --> 00:13:25,664

    -
    Two weeks ago, SG-15...

    - We''ve done this.



    145

    00:13:28,626
    --> 00:13:31,186

    We do this every day.



    146

    00:13:31,266 -->
    00:13:34,781

    Not briefings in general, Daniel.

    I''m talking about this
    briefing.



    147

    00:13:34,866 --> 00:13:37,699

    I''m talking about
    this day.



    148

    00:13:41,626 --> 00:13:47,064

    Colonel O''Neill
    is correct. Events do

    appear to be repeating themselves.



    149

    00:13:47,266
    --> 00:13:50,781

    - Since when?

    - Since we went to P4X-639.



    150

    00:13:51,026
    --> 00:13:53,017

    We haven''t been to P4X-639.



    151

    00:13:53,106
    --> 00:13:56,894

    Yes, we have. ''''No, we haven''t.''''

    That''s what
    you were gonna say.



    152

    00:13:56,986 --> 00:14:01,377

    - Of course
    that''s what I was gonna say.

    - OK, bad example.



    153

    00:14:01,466
    --> 00:14:05,539

    - I''m not quite sure what to make of this.

    - If we''ve
    had this meeting before, sir...



    154

    00:14:05,626 --> 00:14:10,256

    Why
    are Teal''c and I the only ones who

    remember it? You said that last time.



    155

    00:14:10,346
    --> 00:14:14,180

    Well, I''ll venture a guess it has

    something to do
    with that planet.



    156

    00:14:15,746 --> 00:14:19,534

    And you''ll
    all believe me when

    SG-12 comes through that gate in...



    157

    00:14:19,626
    --> 00:14:22,265

    ..four, three, two, one...



    158

    00:14:31,786
    --> 00:14:34,220

    SG-12 isn''t due back for three days.



    159

    00:14:34,986
    --> 00:14:38,217

    - (PA) Unscheduled offworld activation.

    - So close.



    160

    00:14:51,626
    --> 00:14:56,336

    - You''re not gonna find anything.

    - Why don''t we
    wait for the lab results?



    161

    00:14:56,426 --> 00:14:59,498

    -
    The results will be negative.

    - Humour me.



    162

    00:15:01,226
    --> 00:15:06,346

    General... I know you''re thinking of

    postponing the
    mission. There''s no point.



    163

    00:15:06,426 --> 00:15:09,020

    You
    tried it last time. It didn''t work.



    164

    00:15:19,826 --> 00:15:22,021

    Jack.
    Wait up.



    165

    00:15:22,426 --> 00:15:27,864

    Um... I was thinking
    about what you said

    about a beam coming from the altar.



    166

    00:15:28,026
    --> 00:15:30,256

    400 pages of alien text.



    167

    00:15:32,826 -->
    00:15:37,263

    Right... SG-15 took digital images

    of the carvings on
    the ruins.



    168

    00:15:39,426 --> 00:15:41,257

    - Looks familiar.

    -
    It should.



    169

    00:15:41,346 --> 00:15:43,576

    It''s something
    that

    you spoke for a few days.



    170

    00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:47,056

    It''s
    a variation of the writings

    used by the Ancients.



    171

    00:15:47,146
    --> 00:15:51,219

    If you''re lookin'' for help translating it,

    you''re
    barkin'' up the wrong genius.



    172

    00:15:51,306 --> 00:15:56,300

    No,
    I realise the Asgards returned you to

    normal, which is fortunate, l... suppose.



    173

    00:15:56,586
    --> 00:16:00,864

    But if you give me details about

    the layout of the
    ruins it might be...



    174

    00:16:02,066 --> 00:16:04,341

    Gee,
    sorry, Dr Jackson.



    175

    00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:06,138

    Oops.



    176

    00:16:11,466
    --> 00:16:12,785

    Come in.



    177

    00:16:14,986 --> 00:16:18,342

    -
    Any word from Fraiser?

    - Still waiting for the lab results.



    178

    00:16:18,426
    --> 00:16:20,735

    If we delay any longer it will be too late.



    179

    00:16:22,466
    --> 00:16:26,175

    - Too late for what?

    - To stop this day from happening
    again.



    180

    00:16:26,266 --> 00:16:29,144

    You realise this is

    a
    little difficult for me to accept.



    181

    00:16:29,266 --> 00:16:31,905

    Hey,
    if it was just me, I''d agree.



    182

    00:16:31,986 --> 00:16:36,264

    But
    what about Teal''c?

    Come on! ls this the face of a crazy man?



    183

    00:16:42,146
    --> 00:16:44,819

    - Bad example.

    - What do you want?



    184

    00:16:45,266
    --> 00:16:47,655

    We wanna go back to 639.



    185

    00:17:02,666 -->
    00:17:06,375

    A geomagnetic storm is building up.

    We shouldn''t stay
    long.



    186

    00:17:06,466 --> 00:17:08,775

    That''s the machine
    right there.



    187

    00:17:10,306 --> 00:17:14,379

    - I wonder how
    it works.

    - Subspace fields and time inversions.



    188

    00:17:15,306
    --> 00:17:16,944

    That''s what you said.



    189

    00:17:21,826 -->
    00:17:24,579

    - Hello.

    - Whoa. Easy, guys.



    190

    00:17:24,666
    --> 00:17:27,624

    That''s the guy.

    He''s the one who started all this.



    191

    00:17:28,066
    --> 00:17:30,739

    - I don''t understand.

    - Whatever you did, undo it.



    192

    00:17:30,826
    --> 00:17:33,898

    - I did nothing.

    - I don''t think he knows what you
    mean.



    193

    00:17:34,066 --> 00:17:36,660

    - Perhaps he has no
    memory, O''Neill.

    - He remembers.



    194

    00:17:36,746 --> 00:17:38,782

    He''s
    the one who pushed those buttons.



    195

    00:17:38,866 --> 00:17:42,336

    Please.
    I''m, uh, an archaeologist...



    196

    00:17:43,106 --> 00:17:46,416

    I''ve
    been trying to translate

    these alien symbols.



    197

    00:17:46,506
    --> 00:17:49,384

    - I told the others who came before you.

    - SG-15?



    198

    00:17:49,906
    --> 00:17:52,625

    Yes... But they didn''t

    point weapons at me.



    199

    00:17:54,506
    --> 00:17:56,736

    I can show you my notes...



    200

    00:17:57,346
    --> 00:18:01,055

    I''ve been making periodic visits

    to this planet for
    quite some time now.



    201

    00:18:01,146 --> 00:18:03,740

    My research
    is almost complete.



    202

    00:18:08,066 --> 00:18:11,138

    What kind
    of archaeologist

    carries a weapon?



    203

    00:18:11,586 --> 00:18:12,814

    Uh...



    204

    00:18:12,906
    --> 00:18:14,419

    I do.



    205

    00:18:15,746 --> 00:18:17,941

    Bad
    example.



    206

    00:18:29,866 --> 00:18:33,779

    - What''s this?

    -
    If you must know... it''s my wife.



    207

    00:18:33,866 --> 00:18:36,061

    (high-pitched
    sound)



    208

    00:18:46,026 --> 00:18:49,462

    - What''d you do?

    -
    Nothing. It engaged on its own.



    209

    00:18:49,746 --> 00:18:51,338

    -
    Turn it off.

    - How?



    210

    00:18:51,426 --> 00:18:54,941

    It''s
    drawing energy from

    the ionisation in the atmosphere.



    211

    00:18:55,026
    --> 00:18:57,335

    There''s nothing Major Carter can do.



    212

    00:18:57,426
    --> 00:19:00,020

    Excuse me? How''d you know her name?



    213

    00:19:03,106
    --> 00:19:06,815

    - You told me.

    - No, I didn''t. Not this time around.



    214

    00:19:08,826
    --> 00:19:11,818

    It doesn''t matter. You''re too late.



    215

    00:19:13,626
    --> 00:19:17,301

    - How do you shut this thing off?

    - Even if I knew,
    I wouldn''t tell you.



    216

    00:19:17,386 --> 00:19:19,820

    Sir,
    it''s building up some kind of charge.



    217

    00:19:19,946 --> 00:19:23,177

    Daniel,
    you can read this stuff.

    Get up here and shut it off.



    218

    00:19:23,266
    --> 00:19:27,623

    What? Are you kidding me?

    I wouldn''t even know where
    to begin. I...



    219

    00:19:27,706 --> 00:19:32,905

    It would take
    years of training. I don''t

    know the material, I don''t have enough...



    220

    00:19:33,546
    --> 00:19:37,175

    Anyway, I''m sorry, but that just

    happens to be how
    I feel about it.



    221

    00:19:37,266 --> 00:19:39,655

    What do you
    think?



    222

    00:19:44,746 --> 00:19:47,021

    It''s just a question.



    223

    00:19:55,146
    --> 00:19:59,617

    All right. Here''s the deal. We''re all

    stuck in a
    time loop of some kind.



    224

    00:20:00,106 --> 00:20:03,621

    However,
    Teal''c and I seem to be

    the only ones who realise it.



    225

    00:20:03,706
    --> 00:20:06,095

    Now, there''s this alien device on 639.



    226

    00:20:06,186
    --> 00:20:10,498

    It shoots a beam at the Stargate,

    which at... subspace
    something... what?



    227

    00:20:10,586 --> 00:20:14,022

    Accesses
    the subspace field

    the Stargate is capable of generating.



    228

    00:20:14,106
    --> 00:20:19,305

    - It is powered by ionisation...

    - In the atmosphere,
    which is caused by...



    229

    00:20:19,386 --> 00:20:21,661

    I know
    this one.



    230

    00:20:22,946 --> 00:20:25,699

    - Magnets.

    -
    The geomagnetic storm.



    231

    00:20:27,306 --> 00:20:31,982

    Close.
    Anyway, I don''t know why

    none of you remember any of this.



    232

    00:20:32,306
    --> 00:20:37,141

    But I do know for a fact there''s no point

    havin''
    ol'' Doc Fraiser examine us again.



    233

    00:20:49,506 --> 00:20:54,899

    I
    ask you, what could possibly be

    in my eye that would explain this?



    234

    00:21:03,066
    --> 00:21:07,059

    - What do you make of all this, Major?

    - When was
    the last time Colonel O''Neill...



    235

    00:21:07,146 --> 00:21:10,661

    ..used
    terms like ''''subspace field''''

    and ''''geomagnetic storm''''?



    236

    00:21:10,746
    --> 00:21:14,182

    - Good point.

    - And he actually used them correctly,...



    237

    00:21:14,266
    --> 00:21:16,257

    ..for the most part.



    238

    00:21:16,346 --> 00:21:19,736

    -
    You believe him.

    - I''m considering the possibility, sir.



    239

    00:21:19,826
    --> 00:21:23,455

    The more I think about it, if he''s right,

    the ramifications
    are huge.



    240

    00:21:23,546 --> 00:21:27,744

    The next time time
    loops, we''ll forget

    this conversation even happened.



    241

    00:21:33,506
    --> 00:21:37,294

    - You''re better off in here.

    - I was just comin''
    to look for you.



    242

    00:21:37,986 --> 00:21:40,580

    Um, I''ve
    translated

    a section of the west wall.



    243

    00:21:40,666 -->
    00:21:44,705

    - It''s some sort of planetary history.

    - Daniel, that''s
    very nice.



    244

    00:21:44,786 --> 00:21:47,823

    - But focus on
    the altar.

    - Why?



    245

    00:21:47,906 --> 00:21:50,864

    Malikai
    initiated the time loop

    by manipulating symbols.



    246

    00:21:50,946
    --> 00:21:53,540

    Figure out those,

    you figure out how to stop this.



    247

    00:21:53,626
    --> 00:21:57,141

    Just recognising symbols on a keyboard

    doesn''t run
    a computer.



    248

    00:21:57,226 --> 00:22:01,538

    If I can put the
    device in a proper context,

    I can figure out what it''s supposed to do.



    249

    00:22:01,626
    --> 00:22:04,663

    We know what it does!

    It''s a time-loop machine.



    250

    00:22:04,746
    --> 00:22:07,977

    Uh... Who would build a device

    that loops time every
    ten hours?



    251

    00:22:08,066 --> 00:22:11,945

    - Who knows? But
    that''s what it does.

    - Yes, but maybe it''s not supposed to.



    252

    00:22:12,026
    --> 00:22:14,665

    For all we know, this is

    an accidental by-product.



    253

    00:22:14,746
    --> 00:22:16,941

    (phone rings)



    254

    00:22:19,146 --> 00:22:21,137

    Hello?



    255

    00:22:22,626
    --> 00:22:24,935

    OK, we''re on our way.



    256

    00:22:25,026 -->
    00:22:27,415

    Sam has something.



    257

    00:22:32,466 --> 00:22:34,457

    According
    to Colonel O''Neill,...



    258

    00:22:34,546 --> 00:22:38,744

    ..he
    and Teal''c witnessed a beam

    striking the Stargate on P4X-639.



    259

    00:22:38,826
    --> 00:22:41,340

    Then the gate became

    energised somehow.



    260

    00:22:41,426
    --> 00:22:46,546

    Now, in the second loop, they witnessed

    a similar
    effect in our own gate room.



    261

    00:22:46,906 --> 00:22:48,817

    Sounds
    about right.



    262

    00:22:48,906 --> 00:22:51,466

    If this is the
    influence

    of alien technology,...



    263

    00:22:51,546 --> 00:22:55,175

    ..the
    effect is being translated

    to Earth through the Stargate,...



    264

    00:22:55,266
    --> 00:22:57,382

    ..in which case the solution is simple.



    265

    00:22:57,466
    --> 00:22:59,138

    - We dial out.

    - Exactly.



    266

    00:22:59,226
    --> 00:23:01,581

    Before this loop

    is supposed to begin again,...



    267

    00:23:01,666
    --> 00:23:05,295

    ..we establish an outgoing wormhole

    to, say, the Tollan
    home world.



    268

    00:23:05,666 --> 00:23:10,535

    Then anyone or
    anything trying to dial in

    from P4X-639 will get a busy signal.



    269

    00:23:13,946
    --> 00:23:15,937

    Let''s do it.



    270

    00:23:20,106 --> 00:23:22,574

    Chevron
    five, locked.



    271

    00:23:25,826 --> 00:23:28,420

    Chevron six,
    locked.



    272

    00:23:38,306 --> 00:23:40,456

    - Chevron seven will
    not engage.

    - What?



    273

    00:23:40,546 --> 00:23:43,060

    It
    won''t lock.

    I can''t establish a connection.



    274

    00:23:43,146
    --> 00:23:45,614

    I''m running a diagnostic.



    275

    00:23:50,306
    --> 00:23:52,376

    - Incoming wormhole.

    - Close the iris.



    276

    00:23:58,146
    --> 00:23:59,738

    Oh, crap.



    277

    00:23:59,826 --> 00:24:04,695

    There
    is nothing wrong on our end.

    We should have been able to dial out.



    278

    00:24:14,426
    --> 00:24:17,384

    I''m sorry, but that just

    happens to be how I feel
    about it.



    279

    00:24:17,466 --> 00:24:19,855

    What do you think?



    280

    00:24:21,266
    --> 00:24:23,541

    Ask me tomorrow.



    281

    00:24:35,346 --> 00:24:38,179

    Recognising
    symbols on a keyboard

    won''t run a computer.



    282

    00:24:38,266
    --> 00:24:40,302

    We''ve been over this!



    283

    00:24:41,466 -->
    00:24:44,856

    I''m tellin'' you,

    the only way to stop this loop...



    284

    00:24:46,026
    --> 00:24:48,540

    ..is to figure out how to run that stuff!



    285

    00:24:50,586
    --> 00:24:54,101

    If we really have had this conversation,

    I probably
    pointed out...



    286

    00:24:54,186 --> 00:24:57,144

    ..there''s
    no way I can translate this

    in less than a day.



    287

    00:24:57,226
    --> 00:25:01,265

    Oh, I''m so ahead of you.

    I put the whole thing on
    tape last time.



    288

    00:25:01,346 --> 00:25:03,382

    So you don''t
    have to start from scratch.



    289

    00:25:11,586 --> 00:25:13,656

    If
    what you say is true,...



    290

    00:25:13,746 --> 00:25:18,866

    ..when
    the loop started again your

    recording wouldn''t have happened... yet.



    291

    00:25:21,226
    --> 00:25:24,616

    - Right.

    - Did I not say that?



    292

    00:25:24,706
    --> 00:25:27,061

    Careful! Be careful.



    293

    00:25:28,666 --> 00:25:32,136

    What
    about notes? lndelible ink?



    294

    00:25:36,546 --> 00:25:39,618

    If
    you are the only ones

    with memories of previous loops,...



    295

    00:25:39,706
    --> 00:25:43,699

    ..you''re gonna have to help me

    by learning and remembering.



    296

    00:25:47,706
    --> 00:25:49,776

    Fine.



    297

    00:25:49,866 --> 00:25:52,255

    How
    hard can it be?



    298

    00:26:00,026 --> 00:26:04,816

    According
    to Colonel O''Neill, we tried

    to block the connection to P4X-639...



    299

    00:26:04,906
    --> 00:26:06,897

    ..but were unable to dial out.



    300

    00:26:06,986
    --> 00:26:12,538

    I think that the Earth has become out of

    sync with
    the rest of the gate system,...



    301

    00:26:12,626 --> 00:26:15,379

    ..making
    it impossible for us

    to establish contact.



    302

    00:26:15,666
    --> 00:26:17,782

    What about SG-12?

    They managed to gate in.



    303

    00:26:17,866
    --> 00:26:21,336

    I realise that. So we ran

    a sequence of random diallings,...



    304

    00:26:21,426
    --> 00:26:23,986

    ..and this is what we found.



    305

    00:26:24,066
    --> 00:26:27,058

    These worlds we were able

    to contact, including Alaris,...



    306

    00:26:27,146
    --> 00:26:29,216

    ..where SG-12 was doing its survey.



    307

    00:26:29,306
    --> 00:26:32,935

    But the centre of this group is P4X-639.



    308

    00:26:33,026
    --> 00:26:37,622

    I believe the alien device is establishing

    simultaneous
    connection to these gates,...



    309

    00:26:37,706 --> 00:26:40,459

    ..creating
    a kind of... subspace bubble.



    310

    00:26:40,546 --> 00:26:44,255

    And
    everything within the bubble

    is cut off from the normal flow of time.



    311

    00:26:44,346
    --> 00:26:46,416

    What are the implications of this?



    312

    00:26:46,506
    --> 00:26:50,818

    We could relive the same day thousands

    of times, and
    we''d never know it.



    313

    00:26:51,786 --> 00:26:54,300

    - What
    can we do?

    - Unfortunately, not much.



    314

    00:26:54,546 --> 00:26:58,698

    The
    next time the loop starts we won''t

    even remember we had this conversation.



    315

    00:26:58,786
    --> 00:27:01,425

    It''s up to Teal''c and Colonel O''Neill.



    316

    00:27:03,826
    --> 00:27:05,817

    ''''Poteramus.''''



    317

    00:27:05,906 --> 00:27:08,579

    ''''Poteras...
    potarat.''''



    318

    00:27:09,826 --> 00:27:13,614

    ''''Crem... eras...
    cret... cremus.''''



    319

    00:27:20,826 --> 00:27:23,499

    This is
    a bad idea.



    320

    00:27:23,906 --> 00:27:26,101

    It would appear
    we have no choice.



    321

    00:27:26,666 --> 00:27:28,861

    (alarm)



    322

    00:27:30,906
    --> 00:27:33,784

    (PA) Unscheduled offworld activation.



    323

    00:27:33,866
    --> 00:27:36,539

    You know the worst part about this?



    324

    00:27:37,106
    --> 00:27:40,576

    Every time we loop,

    Daniel asks me a question, and...



    325

    00:27:41,586
    --> 00:27:43,861

    ..l wasn''t listening the first time.



    326

    00:27:43,946
    --> 00:27:46,938

    You are not the only one who

    must endure some discomfort.



    327

    00:27:48,106
    --> 00:27:50,859

    Sorry, sir. I didn''t realise you were there.



    328

    00:27:52,026
    --> 00:27:54,620

    - You have said that on many occasions.

    - I...



    329

    00:27:54,706
    --> 00:27:57,698

    Perhaps next time

    I will not be so forgiving.



    330

    00:28:00,266
    --> 00:28:03,622

    Section 23 ends with

    a reference to ''''perennial
    adventus''''.



    331

    00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:09,179

    - We''ve been
    over this.

    - It means ''''the approaching disaster''''.



    332

    00:28:12,706
    --> 00:28:15,857

    ''''Of the machine itself,

    with recurring use...



    333

    00:28:15,946
    --> 00:28:20,178

    ..the machine... surrenders

    to the rigours of time.''''



    334

    00:28:20,626
    --> 00:28:22,981

    That is incorrect, Daniel Jackson.



    335

    00:28:24,546
    --> 00:28:28,824

    The word ''''abicierum'''' means

    ''''to give up'''',
    not ''''surrender''''.



    336

    00:28:30,546 --> 00:28:35,540

    OK,
    this section of the text seems to deal

    primarily with their arrival on P4X-639.



    337

    00:28:35,906
    --> 00:28:40,377

    OK, this section of the text seems to deal

    primarily
    with their arrival on P4X-639.



    338

    00:28:40,466 --> 00:28:44,618

    Now
    this word here, ''''deductavum'''',

    is a variation of ''''deductum''''.



    339

    00:28:45,066
    --> 00:28:49,457

    OK, this section of the text seems to deal

    primarily
    with their arrival on P4X-639.



    340

    00:28:49,826 --> 00:28:54,183

    This
    appears to be a reference to

    the gradual degeneration of the machine.



    341

    00:28:54,706
    --> 00:28:57,095

    ..foundation of a colony.



    342

    00:29:02,386
    --> 00:29:05,856

    - Guys? This is important.

    - (PA) Unscheduled offworld
    activation.



    343

    00:29:09,866 --> 00:29:14,656

    O''Neill... Should
    we not be assisting

    Daniel Jackson with the translation?



    344

    00:29:15,506
    --> 00:29:17,781

    I''m taking this loop off.



    345

    00:29:23,986
    --> 00:29:26,546

    I''m tellin'' you, Teal''c.



    346

    00:29:26,626
    --> 00:29:29,743

    If we don''t find a way out of this soon,

    I''m gonna
    lose it.



    347

    00:29:31,946 --> 00:29:35,256

    Lose it. It means
    ''''go crazy''''.



    348

    00:29:36,626 --> 00:29:39,299

    Nuts. Insane.



    349

    00:29:39,386
    --> 00:29:42,935

    Bonzo. No longer in possession

    of one''s faculties.



    350

    00:29:43,026
    --> 00:29:45,586

    Three fries short of a Happy Meal.



    351

    00:29:45,666
    --> 00:29:47,019

    Wacko!



    352

    00:29:57,666 --> 00:29:59,657

    Teal''c.



    353

    00:30:00,986
    --> 00:30:04,422

    - Thank you, O''Neill.

    - No, no. Thank you, Teal''c.



    354

    00:30:08,826
    --> 00:30:11,021

    Oh, God!



    355

    00:30:12,946 --> 00:30:16,939

    Exactly
    how many of these loops

    have you... have we been through?



    356

    00:30:18,266
    --> 00:30:20,336

    I''ve lost track.



    357

    00:30:20,946 --> 00:30:24,461

    -
    That must be frustrating.

    - Uh... Yeah.



    358

    00:30:24,786 -->
    00:30:27,698

    On the other hand,

    it is kind of an opportunity.



    359

    00:30:28,506
    --> 00:30:30,576

    - How''s that?

    - Well, think about it.



    360

    00:30:30,666
    --> 00:30:36,024

    If you know in advance that everything

    is going to
    go back to the way it was,...



    361

    00:30:36,106 --> 00:30:38,574

    ..you
    could do anything

    for as long as you want...



    362

    00:30:38,666
    --> 00:30:42,261

    ..without having to

    worry about consequences.



    363

    00:30:52,746
    --> 00:30:55,101

    Excuse me.



    364

    00:31:09,946 --> 00:31:12,938

    -
    (alarm blaring)

    - (bicycle bell ringing)



    365

    00:31:14,346 -->
    00:31:18,021

    - Vern, how''s the wife?

    - Fine... sir.



    366

    00:31:21,306
    --> 00:31:23,297

    Oh, yeah!



    367

    00:31:23,986 --> 00:31:26,181

    That''ll
    play.



    368

    00:31:27,546 --> 00:31:30,014

    How far is Alaris, anyway?



    369

    00:31:30,106
    --> 00:31:32,176

    Several billion miles, O''Neill.



    370

    00:31:32,266
    --> 00:31:34,461

    That''s gotta be a record.



    371

    00:31:52,106
    --> 00:31:54,939

    (Hammond) Colonel O''Neill,

    what the hell are you
    doing?



    372

    00:31:55,026 --> 00:31:57,665

    In the middle of my
    backswing?!



    373

    00:31:58,546 --> 00:32:00,935

    Sorry, sir. I
    didn''t realise...



    374

    00:32:06,266 --> 00:32:08,575

    Excuse
    me, George.



    375

    00:32:08,666 --> 00:32:10,861

    Colonel, what
    are you

    doing out of uniform?



    376

    00:32:10,946 --> 00:32:14,734

    -
    Handing you my resignation.

    - Resigning? What for?



    377

    00:32:14,826
    --> 00:32:17,215

    So I can do... this.



    378

    00:32:25,226 --> 00:32:27,581

    What
    are you smiling at?



    379

    00:32:29,226 --> 00:32:31,421

    Nothin''.



    380

    00:32:40,346
    --> 00:32:45,022

    - What have you got for us, Dr Jackson?

    - Uh, with
    the help of Teal''c and Jack,...



    381

    00:32:45,426 --> 00:32:47,986

    ..l''ve
    managed

    to complete the translation.



    382

    00:32:48,066 --> 00:32:52,662

    As
    I originally suspected, P4X-639

    was once a colony of the Ancients.



    383

    00:32:52,746
    --> 00:32:57,137

    They thrived there until they were

    struck with some
    sort of cataclysm,...



    384

    00:32:57,226 --> 00:32:59,456

    ..perhaps
    a disease.



    385

    00:32:59,746 --> 00:33:03,819

    In any case, facing
    certain destruction,

    they built the time machine.



    386

    00:33:03,906
    --> 00:33:07,137

    To go back and change their history

    to avoid their
    fate.



    387

    00:33:07,346 --> 00:33:09,257

    Right. But it didn''t
    work.



    388

    00:33:09,346 --> 00:33:12,656

    Instead of sending a
    team of scientists

    back to the key moment,...



    389

    00:33:12,746
    --> 00:33:17,456

    ..the device caused a continuous loop,

    like the one
    we''ve been experiencing.



    390

    00:33:17,546 --> 00:33:22,336

    They
    experienced it hundreds of times

    trying to get the machine to work, but...



    391

    00:33:23,306
    --> 00:33:26,855

    They gave up. They shut it down

    and let the end come.



    392

    00:33:27,706
    --> 00:33:29,981

    So the loop can be broken.



    393

    00:33:30,066
    --> 00:33:32,819

    Uh, there''s a section of text on the altar...



    394

    00:33:32,906
    --> 00:33:36,421

    ..that deals with the geomagnetic storms

    that power
    the device.



    395

    00:33:36,506 --> 00:33:39,976

    They recur every
    50 or so years,

    which is why, incidentally, the...



    396

    00:33:40,066
    --> 00:33:41,545

    Yes, sir.



    397

    00:33:42,866 --> 00:33:45,096

    The
    loop can be broken.



    398

    00:33:45,466 --> 00:33:48,060

    I was
    getting to that.



    399

    00:33:48,146 --> 00:33:52,776

    When we activate
    the symbols in the right

    sequence, I think we can shut it down.



    400

    00:33:53,306
    --> 00:33:56,742

    Colonel, have your team geared up

    and ready to embark
    in 30 minutes.



    401

    00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:58,578

    Yes, sir.



    402

    00:34:06,066
    --> 00:34:10,218

    A geomagnetic storm is building up.

    We shouldn''t
    stay long.



    403

    00:34:10,306 --> 00:34:11,739

    Lucky guess.



    404

    00:34:15,586
    --> 00:34:18,783

    - Malikai?

    - I don''t see anyone, sir.



    405

    00:34:20,106
    --> 00:34:23,621

    He''s around here somewhere.

    He knows we''re onto
    him.



    406

    00:34:33,786 --> 00:34:35,777

    Teal''c?



    407

    00:34:40,626
    --> 00:34:43,743

    I''m sorry, but you''ve come

    to break the time loop.



    408

    00:34:43,826
    --> 00:34:46,977

    And I''m afraid I can''t let you do that.



    409

    00:34:56,746
    --> 00:34:59,214

    Get away from that thing.



    410

    00:35:10,906
    --> 00:35:13,864

    Sir, it looks like a variation

    of a Goa''uld force
    shield.



    411

    00:35:13,946 --> 00:35:18,098

    It is, Major. I had
    to trade several

    rare artefacts for the field generator,...



    412

    00:35:18,186
    --> 00:35:20,336

    ..but it was well worth it.



    413

    00:35:21,106
    --> 00:35:26,180

    Malikai? We have to reset those controls

    or the loop''s
    gonna start all over again.



    414

    00:35:26,266 --> 00:35:29,736

    I''m
    counting on it. I need more time.



    415

    00:35:30,346 --> 00:35:34,134

    Once
    I''ve deciphered the symbols,

    I will be able to master the time device.



    416

    00:35:34,346
    --> 00:35:36,735

    Why? So you can be

    king of Groundhog Day?



    417

    00:35:36,826
    --> 00:35:40,296

    Do you think I would do this

    for personal power?



    418

    00:35:40,386
    --> 00:35:42,581

    She...



    419

    00:35:44,786 --> 00:35:47,937

    -
    You wouldn''t understand.

    - What happened?



    420

    00:35:53,466
    --> 00:35:58,984

    She died. 12 years ago. When I found

    this place and
    discovered its purpose,...



    421

    00:35:59,066 --> 00:36:02,775

    ..l
    dedicated myself

    to unlocking its mysteries.



    422

    00:36:02,866
    --> 00:36:05,255

    (Carter) So you could

    go back and save her.



    423

    00:36:05,346
    --> 00:36:09,578

    No, that would be quite impossible. She

    died from
    a congenital heart weakness.



    424

    00:36:09,906 --> 00:36:13,342

    Not
    even the ability to travel time

    could change that.



    425

    00:36:13,426
    --> 00:36:15,986

    Then why are you doing this?



    426

    00:36:16,426
    --> 00:36:18,894

    To be with her once more.



    427

    00:36:20,466
    --> 00:36:23,458

    Malikai, the device doesn''t work.



    428

    00:36:24,266
    --> 00:36:27,224

    - It never did.

    - It never did?



    429

    00:36:28,946
    --> 00:36:32,655

    - You''re living proof.

    - We translated the text on
    the ruins.



    430

    00:36:32,746 --> 00:36:36,295

    The Ancients who
    built this place

    never got it to work.



    431

    00:36:36,386 -->
    00:36:40,584

    They tried over and over again,

    just like you, but in
    the end they gave up.



    432

    00:36:40,666 --> 00:36:44,864

    Why
    do you think this place is deserted?

    They couldn''t save themselves.



    433

    00:36:45,506
    --> 00:36:49,624

    You''re wrong. There must be some other

    explanation.
    I know I can make this work.



    434

    00:36:49,706 --> 00:36:54,382

    You
    can''t! They proved it can''t be done.

    You''re just gonna go on like this
    for ever.



    435

    00:36:54,466 --> 00:36:57,742

    - You''ll be trapped.

    -
    Along with billions of innocent others.



    436

    00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:02,095

    This
    device activates

    14 Stargates simultaneously.



    437

    00:37:02,186
    --> 00:37:05,701

    That''s 14 worlds reliving

    the same day over and over.



    438

    00:37:08,266
    --> 00:37:12,100

    I, uh... I didn''t realise.



    439

    00:37:12,186
    --> 00:37:14,177

    (high-pitched sound)



    440

    00:37:15,266 --> 00:37:20,784

    But
    once I am able to input the correct

    time coordinates, the loop will be broken.



    441

    00:37:20,866
    --> 00:37:24,302

    The people who made that machine

    made the Stargates,...



    442

    00:37:24,386
    --> 00:37:26,900

    ..and they couldn''t get

    the damn thing to work.



    443

    00:37:26,986
    --> 00:37:30,581

    And even if you could,

    just for the sake of argument,...



    444

    00:37:31,506
    --> 00:37:34,498

    ..you can''t change what happened to her.



    445

    00:37:34,586
    --> 00:37:37,737

    I can... touch her face again.



    446

    00:37:38,706
    --> 00:37:41,778

    Talk with her. Hear her laugh.



    447

    00:37:41,866
    --> 00:37:43,777

    - Like you remember?

    - Yes.



    448

    00:37:43,866
    --> 00:37:46,141

    Then what''ll happen?



    449

    00:37:47,146 -->
    00:37:49,535

    - She''ll die.

    - And then what?



    450

    00:37:50,306
    --> 00:37:52,183

    You start over?



    451

    00:37:57,826 --> 00:38:00,181

    Listen
    to me.



    452

    00:38:00,666 --> 00:38:02,941

    - I know what it''s
    like.

    - You can''t!



    453

    00:38:03,106 --> 00:38:06,018

    I
    lost my son! I know!



    454

    00:38:11,466 --> 00:38:13,855

    And as
    much as l...



    455

    00:38:16,426 --> 00:38:19,020

    I could never
    live that over again.



    456

    00:38:22,946 --> 00:38:24,777

    Could
    you?



    457

    00:38:34,706 --> 00:38:36,025

    No.



    458

    00:38:39,266
    --> 00:38:41,655

    Let her go.



    459

    00:39:53,026 --> 00:39:56,985

    Well,
    we''re still here, Colonel.

    I assume you were successful.



    460

    00:39:57,106
    --> 00:39:59,700

    Well, General, you know what they say.



    461

    00:39:59,786
    --> 00:40:02,061

    If at first you don''t succeed,...



    462

    00:40:02,666
    --> 00:40:05,658

    ..try, try, try...



    463

    00:40:05,746 --> 00:40:08,135

    ..try,
    try... try again.



    464

    00:40:16,986 --> 00:40:20,023

    I don''t
    think I''ve ever seen

    anyone enjoy oatmeal so much.



    465

    00:40:20,106
    --> 00:40:25,226

    When you''ve eaten Froot Loops for who

    knows how long...
    a little variety helps.



    466

    00:40:25,306 --> 00:40:30,744

    We
    heard from the Tok''ra. They''ve been

    trying to contact us for over three
    months.



    467

    00:40:31,426 --> 00:40:32,336

    Really?



    468

    00:40:32,426
    --> 00:40:34,656

    Who knows when they realised

    we were cut off.



    469

    00:40:34,746
    --> 00:40:37,419

    I mean, there''s no telling

    how much time passed.



    470

    00:40:37,506
    --> 00:40:42,022

    Let me ask you something.

    In all the time you were,
    um, looping,...



    471

    00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:45,576

    ..were you
    ever tempted

    to, um, do something crazy?



    472

    00:40:46,026 -->
    00:40:51,419

    I mean, uh... You could do anything

    without worrying about
    consequences.



    473

    00:40:54,946 --> 00:40:57,460

    You know, it''s
    funny.

    You''ve asked me that before.



    474

    00:40:58,226 --> 00:41:00,217

    And?



    475

    00:41:57,666
    --> 00:41:59,736

    00:00:39,626 --> 00:00:41,617

    Is it supposed to be
    doing that?



    2

    00:00:41,706 --> 00:00:45,824

    It''s a coronal
    mass emission,

    like a giant solar flare.



    3

    00:00:46,266 -->
    00:00:49,781

    - But it''s safe, right?

    - That''s what this equipment
    will find out.



    4

    00:00:49,866 --> 00:00:55,259

    Apart from disrupting
    the magnetic field,

    it might cause an increase in radiation.



    5

    00:00:55,346
    --> 00:00:57,223

    But it''s safe, right?



    6

    00:00:57,306 --> 00:01:00,582

    As
    long as we don''t

    stay here too long, yes, sir.



    7

    00:01:00,666
    --> 00:01:03,055

    Anyone explain that to Daniel?



    8

    00:01:10,266
    --> 00:01:12,939

    I''ve encountered this script before.



    9

    00:01:13,026
    --> 00:01:18,020

    It''s, uh, similar in pronunciation to

    a language
    on our planet called Latin.



    10

    00:01:20,386 --> 00:01:24,299

    As
    near as I can tell, the main body of

    the text represents a planetary history.



    11

    00:01:24,386
    --> 00:01:28,937

    I agree... But isn''t it time for you

    to return through
    the Stargate?



    12

    00:01:29,026 --> 00:01:34,225

    I don''t understand
    the significance of

    what this is. A sort of control mechanism.



    13

    00:01:34,866
    --> 00:01:39,815

    It''s obviously still in working order.

    I wonder if
    that''s... significant.



    14

    00:01:40,786 --> 00:01:44,779

    The
    storm is approaching, Dr Jackson.

    The radiation may be dangerous for you.



    15

    00:01:44,866
    --> 00:01:47,824

    Oh, yes. Major Carter will let us

    know when we have
    to leave.



    16

    00:01:47,906 --> 00:01:53,264

    Now, this line recurs
    several times:

    ''''Domavatus vestul motabilum.''''



    17

    00:01:54,466
    --> 00:01:56,343

    ''''Conqueror of time.''''



    18

    00:01:56,426
    --> 00:01:59,941

    In this context, I''d say more like

    ''''Master of
    the uncertain past.''''



    19

    00:02:00,026 --> 00:02:03,018

    - You''re
    a skilled linguist, Dr Jackson.

    - Thank you.



    20

    00:02:03,106
    --> 00:02:06,815

    I had the opportunity to hear the language

    spoken
    a year or so ago, so...



    21

    00:02:06,906 --> 00:02:08,897

    (high-pitched
    sound)



    22

    00:02:10,146 --> 00:02:11,465

    What''s that?



    23

    00:02:11,546
    --> 00:02:15,824

    The geomagnetic disturbance

    is reaching its peak.
    I have to act now.



    24

    00:02:19,266 --> 00:02:20,745

    I don''t
    understand.



    25

    00:02:52,306 --> 00:02:54,342

    - All set up, sir.

    -
    Good.



    26

    00:02:54,986 --> 00:02:56,817

    Let''s hit it.



    27

    00:02:56,906
    --> 00:02:59,215

    Daniel, let''s go home.



    28

    00:03:04,066 -->
    00:03:05,294

    Daniel?



    29

    00:03:07,466 --> 00:03:09,138

    (electricity
    crackling)



    30

    00:03:13,906 --> 00:03:17,216

    - O''Neill.

    -
    Yeah, I hear it.



    31

    00:03:33,746 --> 00:03:36,340

    Incoming wormhole.



    32

    00:03:41,506
    --> 00:03:43,144

    What is that?



    33

    00:03:43,786 --> 00:03:45,583

    I
    have no idea, sir.



    34

    00:03:50,786 --> 00:03:52,663

    Are you
    doin'' this?



    35

    00:03:52,906 --> 00:03:55,864

    - Stay away!

    -
    What the hell are you doing?



    36

    00:03:56,266 --> 00:03:58,257

    Stay
    back!



    37

    00:04:02,946 --> 00:04:04,265

    Colonel!



    38

    00:04:07,106
    --> 00:04:10,701

    Anyway, I''m sorry, but that just

    happens to be how
    I feel about it.



    39

    00:04:10,786 --> 00:04:13,175

    What do you
    think?



    40

    00:04:19,466 --> 00:04:21,457

    What?



    41

    00:04:24,146
    --> 00:04:26,899

    What do you think?



    42

    00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:32,178

    Colonel?
    ls something wrong?



    43

    00:04:33,386 --> 00:04:35,581

    Maybe.



    44

    00:05:42,386
    --> 00:05:44,820

    Weren''t we just somewhere else?



    45

    00:05:46,186
    --> 00:05:48,142

    - Where?

    - Some planet.



    46

    00:05:48,226
    --> 00:05:49,215

    - When?

    - Just now.



    47

    00:05:49,306 -->
    00:05:50,500

    - No.

    - Sure?



    48

    00:05:50,586 --> 00:05:52,656

    Yeah.



    49

    00:05:59,786
    --> 00:06:01,777

    Everything just changed.



    50

    00:06:01,866 -->
    00:06:05,415

    Sir, we''ve been sitting in the commissary

    for the past
    half-hour.



    51

    00:06:05,506 --> 00:06:08,942

    - Really?

    -
    You''ve gotten the two places confused.



    52

    00:06:10,906 --> 00:06:13,466

    -
    We''re gonna be late for the briefing.

    - Briefing?



    53

    00:06:15,986
    --> 00:06:20,502

    Are you OK, or are you just trying

    to avoid answering
    my question?



    54

    00:06:22,106 --> 00:06:24,301

    No, I''m fine.



    55

    00:06:26,066
    --> 00:06:28,261

    What question?



    56

    00:06:36,746 --> 00:06:42,503

    Two
    weeks ago, SG-15 took these images

    of solar activity on P4X-639.



    57

    00:06:42,586
    --> 00:06:46,420

    Analysis of the data indicates

    a steady increase in
    the intensity.



    58

    00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:49,942

    Now, if I''m
    right, the explosions

    that we''re witnessing here...



    59

    00:06:50,026
    --> 00:06:53,018

    ..are just the precursor

    to a greater violent ejection.



    60

    00:06:53,106
    --> 00:06:56,985

    Major Carter? Have we not previously

    been briefed
    concerning this matter?



    61

    00:06:57,066 --> 00:06:59,580

    - I
    was just gonna say that.

    - Sir?



    62

    00:07:01,066 --> 00:07:05,582

    You
    wanna go to the planet and set up

    some kind of remote observatory.



    63

    00:07:07,026
    --> 00:07:09,062

    - Yes.

    - We just did that.



    64

    00:07:09,306
    --> 00:07:11,501

    - No, we didn''t.

    - I believe we did.



    65

    00:07:11,586
    --> 00:07:13,542

    No, that''s what the briefing is about.



    66

    00:07:13,626
    --> 00:07:16,424

    I remember listening to Carter prattle on...



    67

    00:07:16,506
    --> 00:07:19,623

    ..about solar activity

    and a... corona something.



    68

    00:07:19,706
    --> 00:07:22,266

    Coronal mass emissions.

    I was about to bring it up.



    69

    00:07:22,346
    --> 00:07:26,464

    - There you go. How would I know that?

    - Maybe you
    read my report.



    70

    00:07:27,386 --> 00:07:29,775

    Maybe he read
    your report?



    71

    00:07:32,706 --> 00:07:35,459

    I''m tellin''
    you guys,

    we''ve done this before.



    72

    00:07:35,986 --> 00:07:37,977

    I
    am in agreement with O''Neill.



    73

    00:07:38,066 --> 00:07:42,298

    I
    am experiencing a great deal

    of familiarity with these events.



    74

    00:07:42,386
    --> 00:07:44,900

    (PA) Unscheduled offworld activation.



    75

    00:07:53,186
    --> 00:07:55,654

    We have an unscheduled

    incoming traveller, sir.



    76

    00:07:55,746
    --> 00:07:58,783

    - It''s SG-12.

    - (Hammond) They''re not due for days.



    77

    00:07:58,866
    --> 00:08:01,858

    (technician) Receiving GDO transmission.



    78

    00:08:05,106
    --> 00:08:06,937

    It''s SG-12.



    79

    00:08:10,106 --> 00:08:13,098

    -
    Open the iris.

    - One of them will be injured.



    80

    00:08:26,106
    --> 00:08:30,145

    - What do you make of all of this, Major?

    - Well,
    sir, I''m not sure.



    81

    00:08:30,226 --> 00:08:33,423

    SG-12''s
    early return

    was the result of an accident.



    82

    00:08:33,506
    --> 00:08:35,656

    One of the team fell and broke his ankle.



    83

    00:08:35,746
    --> 00:08:39,216

    How could Teal''c and Colonel O''Neill

    know that was
    going to happen?



    84

    00:08:39,306 --> 00:08:43,345

    Both of them
    claim to have memories

    of SG-1''s mission to P4X-639.



    85

    00:08:43,426
    --> 00:08:47,135

    A mission that isn''t scheduled

    to start for six hours.



    86

    00:08:55,906
    --> 00:09:00,104

    OK. So Sam was setting up instruments,

    and... where
    was l?



    87

    00:09:00,866 --> 00:09:03,505

    You were by the altar
    deal with the guy.



    88

    00:09:03,986 --> 00:09:08,025

    Right. You''re
    gonna need

    to be a little more specific.



    89

    00:09:09,546 -->
    00:09:10,820

    Malikai.



    90

    00:09:10,906 --> 00:09:15,024

    That''s
    the alien archaeologist

    SG-15 met on the first survey.



    91

    00:09:15,106
    --> 00:09:18,416

    - I was looking forward to meeting him.

    - You did.



    92

    00:09:18,506
    --> 00:09:20,815

    You got along swell.



    93

    00:09:21,946 --> 00:09:26,542

    Anyway,
    a beam shot out from the ruins

    around the altar and hit the Stargate.



    94

    00:09:27,906
    --> 00:09:30,215

    There was a blinding flash of light.



    95

    00:09:30,306
    --> 00:09:34,140

    Then I was back in the commissary

    eating my Froot
    Loops.



    96

    00:09:37,946 --> 00:09:40,540

    I can''t find anything
    wrong

    with either of them.



    97

    00:09:40,626 --> 00:09:45,177

    We''ll
    wait for the lab results to be sure,

    but they appear to be in perfect health.



    98

    00:09:45,266
    --> 00:09:48,224

    Except for remembering events

    that haven''t happened
    yet.



    99

    00:09:48,586 --> 00:09:53,182

    - But why Jack and Teal''c
    and not us?

    - I''m not takin'' any chances.



    100

    00:09:53,266
    --> 00:09:58,056

    Until we figure out what''s going on,

    I''m postponing
    your mission to P4X-639.



    101

    00:10:10,626 --> 00:10:12,821

    Jack.
    Wait up.



    102

    00:10:13,466 --> 00:10:18,745

    Um... I was thinking
    about what you said

    about, uh, a beam coming out of the altar.



    103

    00:10:18,826
    --> 00:10:22,899

    SG-15 took digital images

    of the carvings on the ruins.



    104

    00:10:23,186
    --> 00:10:25,746

    I was thinking there might be

    some sort of clue.



    105

    00:10:25,826
    --> 00:10:29,136

    Unfortunately it''s the equivalent

    of 400 pages of
    alien text.



    106

    00:10:29,226 --> 00:10:32,616

    If you give me
    details about

    the layout of the ruins...



    107

    00:10:34,666 -->
    00:10:36,941

    Gee, sorry, Dr Jackson.



    108

    00:10:38,066 --> 00:10:40,455

    Shoulda
    seen that comin''.



    109

    00:10:51,266 --> 00:10:52,221

    So...



    110

    00:10:53,066
    --> 00:10:54,215

    So?



    111

    00:10:55,746 --> 00:10:58,385

    Don''t
    you know what I''m gonna say?



    112

    00:10:58,466 --> 00:11:02,744

    Actually,
    by this time

    we were on the planet.



    113

    00:11:02,826 --> 00:11:04,737

    It''s
    all different now.



    114

    00:11:04,826 --> 00:11:05,815

    Oh.



    115

    00:11:05,906
    --> 00:11:11,026

    Well, I was thinking about what you said

    about a beam
    hitting the Stargate.



    116

    00:11:11,106 --> 00:11:13,336

    - What
    about it?

    - After the flash,...



    117

    00:11:13,426 --> 00:11:17,544

    ..you
    found yourself back here, reliving

    the moments leading up to the mission.



    118

    00:11:18,506
    --> 00:11:21,384

    Maybe you''re not

    remembering future events.



    119

    00:11:21,466
    --> 00:11:25,425

    - Maybe you were sent back in time.

    - For what? Six
    hours?



    120

    00:11:25,506 --> 00:11:30,580

    Well, it wouldn''t
    be the first time.

    The Stargate did send us back to 1969.



    121

    00:11:31,506
    --> 00:11:33,497

    Good year.



    122

    00:11:33,586 --> 00:11:39,218

    So
    could this beam be a means

    to access the gate''s subspace field...



    123

    00:11:39,306
    --> 00:11:43,697

    ..in order to create some kind of

    time inversion outside
    of subspace?



    124

    00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:51,260

    I knew you were
    gonna say that.



    125

    00:11:51,986 --> 00:11:54,341

    I guess I''m
    just thinkin'' out loud.



    126

    00:11:54,426 --> 00:11:57,020

    I''m
    gonna go run a few simulations.



    127

    00:11:58,826 --> 00:12:01,340

    You
    run... Simulate.



    128

    00:12:03,826 --> 00:12:06,818

    Let me know
    how it turns out.

    Keep me posted.



    129

    00:12:10,066 --> 00:12:12,216

    Keep
    me apprised.



    130

    00:12:18,226 --> 00:12:22,777

    The lab results
    confirm Dr Fraiser''s

    assessment. You''re both in perfect health.



    131

    00:12:24,946
    --> 00:12:28,825

    - Any more of these premonitions?

    - Not for some time.



    132

    00:12:28,906
    --> 00:12:31,420

    Can we go back to work, General, please?



    133

    00:12:31,506
    --> 00:12:33,861

    I have no objection, as long as...



    134

    00:12:33,946
    --> 00:12:36,460

    (PA) Unscheduled offworld activation.



    135

    00:12:38,906
    --> 00:12:40,897

    D''oh!



    136

    00:12:51,346 --> 00:12:53,337

    What
    is that?



    137

    00:12:53,426 --> 00:12:56,702

    I''m not sure, sir.

    I''ve
    never seen anything like it.



    138

    00:12:56,786 --> 00:12:58,777

    We
    have.



    139

    00:13:00,066 --> 00:13:03,661

    Anyway, I''m sorry,
    but that just

    happens to be how I feel about it.



    140

    00:13:03,746
    --> 00:13:06,135

    What do you think?



    141

    00:13:11,786 --> 00:13:14,380

    Colonel?
    ls something wrong?



    142

    00:13:15,346 --> 00:13:17,496

    Oh, yeah.



    143

    00:13:17,586
    --> 00:13:19,577

    Somethin''.



    144

    00:13:22,866 --> 00:13:25,664

    -
    Two weeks ago, SG-15...

    - We''ve done this.



    145

    00:13:28,626
    --> 00:13:31,186

    We do this every day.



    146

    00:13:31,266 -->
    00:13:34,781

    Not briefings in general, Daniel.

    I''m talking about this
    briefing.



    147

    00:13:34,866 --> 00:13:37,699

    I''m talking about
    this day.



    148

    00:13:41,626 --> 00:13:47,064

    Colonel O''Neill
    is correct. Events do

    appear to be repeating themselves.



    149

    00:13:47,266
    --> 00:13:50,781

    - Since when?

    - Since we went to P4X-639.



    150

    00:13:51,026
    --> 00:13:53,017

    We haven''t been to P4X-639.



    151

    00:13:53,106
    --> 00:13:56,894

    Yes, we have. ''''No, we haven''t.''''

    That''s what
    you were gonna say.



    152

    00:13:56,986 --> 00:14:01,377

    - Of course
    that''s what I was gonna say.

    - OK, bad example.



    153

    00:14:01,466
    --> 00:14:05,539

    - I''m not quite sure what to make of this.

    - If we''ve
    had this meeting before, sir...



    154

    00:14:05,626 --> 00:14:10,256

    Why
    are Teal''c and I the only ones who

    remember it? You said that last time.



    155

    00:14:10,346
    --> 00:14:14,180

    Well, I''ll venture a guess it has

    something to do
    with that planet.



    156

    00:14:15,746 --> 00:14:19,534

    And you''ll
    all believe me when

    SG-12 comes through that gate in...



    157

    00:14:19,626
    --> 00:14:22,265

    ..four, three, two, one...



    158

    00:14:31,786
    --> 00:14:34,220

    SG-12 isn''t due back for three days.



    159

    00:14:34,986
    --> 00:14:38,217

    - (PA) Unscheduled offworld activation.

    - So close.



    160

    00:14:51,626
    --> 00:14:56,336

    - You''re not gonna find anything.

    - Why don''t we
    wait for the lab results?



    161

    00:14:56,426 --> 00:14:59,498

    -
    The results will be negative.

    - Humour me.



    162

    00:15:01,226
    --> 00:15:06,346

    General... I know you''re thinking of

    postponing the
    mission. There''s no point.



    163

    00:15:06,426 --> 00:15:09,020

    You
    tried it last time. It didn''t work.



    164

    00:15:19,826 --> 00:15:22,021

    Jack.
    Wait up.



    165

    00:15:22,426 --> 00:15:27,864

    Um... I was thinking
    about what you said

    about a beam coming from the altar.



    166

    00:15:28,026
    --> 00:15:30,256

    400 pages of alien text.



    167

    00:15:32,826 -->
    00:15:37,263

    Right... SG-15 took digital images

    of the carvings on
    the ruins.



    168

    00:15:39,426 --> 00:15:41,257

    - Looks familiar.

    -
    It should.



    169

    00:15:41,346 --> 00:15:43,576

    It''s something
    that

    you spoke for a few days.



    170

    00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:47,056

    It''s
    a variation of the writings

    used by the Ancients.



    171

    00:15:47,146
    --> 00:15:51,219

    If you''re lookin'' for help translating it,

    you''re
    barkin'' up the wrong genius.



    172

    00:15:51,306 --> 00:15:56,300

    No,
    I realise the Asgards returned you to

    normal, which is fortunate, l... suppose.



    173

    00:15:56,586
    --> 00:16:00,864

    But if you give me details about

    the layout of the
    ruins it might be...



    174

    00:16:02,066 --> 00:16:04,341

    Gee,
    sorry, Dr Jackson.



    175

    00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:06,138

    Oops.



    176

    00:16:11,466
    --> 00:16:12,785

    Come in.



    177

    00:16:14,986 --> 00:16:18,342

    -
    Any word from Fraiser?

    - Still waiting for the lab results.



    178

    00:16:18,426
    --> 00:16:20,735

    If we delay any longer it will be too late.



    179

    00:16:22,466
    --> 00:16:26,175

    - Too late for what?

    - To stop this day from happening
    again.



    180

    00:16:26,266 --> 00:16:29,144

    You realise this is

    a
    little difficult for me to accept.



    181

    00:16:29,266 --> 00:16:31,905

    Hey,
    if it was just me, I''d agree.



    182

    00:16:31,986 --> 00:16:36,264

    But
    what about Teal''c?

    Come on! ls this the face of a crazy man?



    183

    00:16:42,146
    --> 00:16:44,819

    - Bad example.

    - What do you want?



    184

    00:16:45,266
    --> 00:16:47,655

    We wanna go back to 639.



    185

    00:17:02,666 -->
    00:17:06,375

    A geomagnetic storm is building up.

    We shouldn''t stay
    long.



    186

    00:17:06,466 --> 00:17:08,775

    That''s the machine
    right there.



    187

    00:17:10,306 --> 00:17:14,379

    - I wonder how
    it works.

    - Subspace fields and time inversions.



    188

    00:17:15,306
    --> 00:17:16,944

    That''s what you said.



    189

    00:17:21,826 -->
    00:17:24,579

    - Hello.

    - Whoa. Easy, guys.



    190

    00:17:24,666
    --> 00:17:27,624

    That''s the guy.

    He''s the one who started all this.



    191

    00:17:28,066
    --> 00:17:30,739

    - I don''t understand.

    - Whatever you did, undo it.



    192

    00:17:30,826
    --> 00:17:33,898

    - I did nothing.

    - I don''t think he knows what you
    mean.



    193

    00:17:34,066 --> 00:17:36,660

    - Perhaps he has no
    memory, O''Neill.

    - He remembers.



    194

    00:17:36,746 --> 00:17:38,782

    He''s
    the one who pushed those buttons.



    195

    00:17:38,866 --> 00:17:42,336

    Please.
    I''m, uh, an archaeologist...



    196

    00:17:43,106 --> 00:17:46,416

    I''ve
    been trying to translate

    these alien symbols.



    197

    00:17:46,506
    --> 00:17:49,384

    - I told the others who came before you.

    - SG-15?



    198

    00:17:49,906
    --> 00:17:52,625

    Yes... But they didn''t

    point weapons at me.



    199

    00:17:54,506
    --> 00:17:56,736

    I can show you my notes...



    200

    00:17:57,346
    --> 00:18:01,055

    I''ve been making periodic visits

    to this planet for
    quite some time now.



    201

    00:18:01,146 --> 00:18:03,740

    My research
    is almost complete.



    202

    00:18:08,066 --> 00:18:11,138

    What kind
    of archaeologist

    carries a weapon?



    203

    00:18:11,586 --> 00:18:12,814

    Uh...



    204

    00:18:12,906
    --> 00:18:14,419

    I do.



    205

    00:18:15,746 --> 00:18:17,941

    Bad
    example.



    206

    00:18:29,866 --> 00:18:33,779

    - What''s this?

    -
    If you must know... it''s my wife.



    207

    00:18:33,866 --> 00:18:36,061

    (high-pitched
    sound)



    208

    00:18:46,026 --> 00:18:49,462

    - What''d you do?

    -
    Nothing. It engaged on its own.



    209

    00:18:49,746 --> 00:18:51,338

    -
    Turn it off.

    - How?



    210

    00:18:51,426 --> 00:18:54,941

    It''s
    drawing energy from

    the ionisation in the atmosphere.



    211

    00:18:55,026
    --> 00:18:57,335

    There''s nothing Major Carter can do.



    212

    00:18:57,426
    --> 00:19:00,020

    Excuse me? How''d you know her name?



    213

    00:19:03,106
    --> 00:19:06,815

    - You told me.

    - No, I didn''t. Not this time around.



    214

    00:19:08,826
    --> 00:19:11,818

    It doesn''t matter. You''re too late.



    215

    00:19:13,626
    --> 00:19:17,301

    - How do you shut this thing off?

    - Even if I knew,
    I wouldn''t tell you.



    216

    00:19:17,386 --> 00:19:19,820

    Sir,
    it''s building up some kind of charge.



    217

    00:19:19,946 --> 00:19:23,177

    Daniel,
    you can read this stuff.

    Get up here and shut it off.



    218

    00:19:23,266
    --> 00:19:27,623

    What? Are you kidding me?

    I wouldn''t even know where
    to begin. I...



    219

    00:19:27,706 --> 00:19:32,905

    It would take
    years of training. I don''t

    know the material, I don''t have enough...



    220

    00:19:33,546
    --> 00:19:37,175

    Anyway, I''m sorry, but that just

    happens to be how
    I feel about it.



    221

    00:19:37,266 --> 00:19:39,655

    What do you
    think?



    222

    00:19:44,746 --> 00:19:47,021

    It''s just a question.



    223

    00:19:55,146
    --> 00:19:59,617

    All right. Here''s the deal. We''re all

    stuck in a
    time loop of some kind.



    224

    00:20:00,106 --> 00:20:03,621

    However,
    Teal''c and I seem to be

    the only ones who realise it.



    225

    00:20:03,706
    --> 00:20:06,095

    Now, there''s this alien device on 639.



    226

    00:20:06,186
    --> 00:20:10,498

    It shoots a beam at the Stargate,

    which at... subspace
    something... what?



    227

    00:20:10,586 --> 00:20:14,022

    Accesses
    the subspace field

    the Stargate is capable of generating.



    228

    00:20:14,106
    --> 00:20:19,305

    - It is powered by ionisation...

    - In the atmosphere,
    which is caused by...



    229

    00:20:19,386 --> 00:20:21,661

    I know
    this one.



    230

    00:20:22,946 --> 00:20:25,699

    - Magnets.

    -
    The geomagnetic storm.



    231

    00:20:27,306 --> 00:20:31,982

    Close.
    Anyway, I don''t know why

    none of you remember any of this.



    232

    00:20:32,306
    --> 00:20:37,141

    But I do know for a fact there''s no point

    havin''
    ol'' Doc Fraiser examine us again.



    233

    00:20:49,506 --> 00:20:54,899

    I
    ask you, what could possibly be

    in my eye that would explain this?



    234

    00:21:03,066
    --> 00:21:07,059

    - What do you make of all this, Major?

    - When was
    the last time Colonel O''Neill...



    235

    00:21:07,146 --> 00:21:10,661

    ..used
    terms like ''''subspace field''''

    and ''''geomagnetic storm''''?



    236

    00:21:10,746
    --> 00:21:14,182

    - Good point.

    - And he actually used them correctly,...



    237

    00:21:14,266
    --> 00:21:16,257

    ..for the most part.



    238

    00:21:16,346 --> 00:21:19,736

    -
    You believe him.

    - I''m considering the possibility, sir.



    239

    00:21:19,826
    --> 00:21:23,455

    The more I think about it, if he''s right,

    the ramifications
    are huge.



    240

    00:21:23,546 --> 00:21:27,744

    The next time time
    loops, we''ll forget

    this conversation even happened.



    241

    00:21:33,506
    --> 00:21:37,294

    - You''re better off in here.

    - I was just comin''
    to look for you.



    242

    00:21:37,986 --> 00:21:40,580

    Um, I''ve
    translated

    a section of the west wall.



    243

    00:21:40,666 -->
    00:21:44,705

    - It''s some sort of planetary history.

    - Daniel, that''s
    very nice.



    244

    00:21:44,786 --> 00:21:47,823

    - But focus on
    the altar.

    - Why?



    245

    00:21:47,906 --> 00:21:50,864

    Malikai
    initiated the time loop

    by manipulating symbols.



    246

    00:21:50,946
    --> 00:21:53,540

    Figure out those,

    you figure out how to stop this.



    247

    00:21:53,626
    --> 00:21:57,141

    Just recognising symbols on a keyboard

    doesn''t run
    a computer.



    248

    00:21:57,226 --> 00:22:01,538

    If I can put the
    device in a proper context,

    I can figure out what it''s supposed to do.



    249

    00:22:01,626
    --> 00:22:04,663

    We know what it does!

    It''s a time-loop machine.



    250

    00:22:04,746
    --> 00:22:07,977

    Uh... Who would build a device

    that loops time every
    ten hours?



    251

    00:22:08,066 --> 00:22:11,945

    - Who knows? But
    that''s what it does.

    - Yes, but maybe it''s not supposed to.



    252

    00:22:12,026
    --> 00:22:14,665

    For all we know, this is

    an accidental by-product.



    253

    00:22:14,746
    --> 00:22:16,941

    (phone rings)



    254

    00:22:19,146 --> 00:22:21,137

    Hello?



    255

    00:22:22,626
    --> 00:22:24,935

    OK, we''re on our way.



    256

    00:22:25,026 -->
    00:22:27,415

    Sam has something.



    257

    00:22:32,466 --> 00:22:34,457

    According
    to Colonel O''Neill,...



    258

    00:22:34,546 --> 00:22:38,744

    ..he
    and Teal''c witnessed a beam

    striking the Stargate on P4X-639.



    259

    00:22:38,826
    --> 00:22:41,340

    Then the gate became

    energised somehow.



    260

    00:22:41,426
    --> 00:22:46,546

    Now, in the second loop, they witnessed

    a similar
    effect in our own gate room.



    261

    00:22:46,906 --> 00:22:48,817

    Sounds
    about right.



    262

    00:22:48,906 --> 00:22:51,466

    If this is the
    influence

    of alien technology,...



    263

    00:22:51,546 --> 00:22:55,175

    ..the
    effect is being translated

    to Earth through the Stargate,...



    264

    00:22:55,266
    --> 00:22:57,382

    ..in which case the solution is simple.



    265

    00:22:57,466
    --> 00:22:59,138

    - We dial out.

    - Exactly.



    266

    00:22:59,226
    --> 00:23:01,581

    Before this loop

    is supposed to begin again,...



    267

    00:23:01,666
    --> 00:23:05,295

    ..we establish an outgoing wormhole

    to, say, the Tollan
    home world.



    268

    00:23:05,666 --> 00:23:10,535

    Then anyone or
    anything trying to dial in

    from P4X-639 will get a busy signal.



    269

    00:23:13,946
    --> 00:23:15,937

    Let''s do it.



    270

    00:23:20,106 --> 00:23:22,574

    Chevron
    five, locked.



    271

    00:23:25,826 --> 00:23:28,420

    Chevron six,
    locked.



    272

    00:23:38,306 --> 00:23:40,456

    - Chevron seven will
    not engage.

    - What?



    273

    00:23:40,546 --> 00:23:43,060

    It
    won''t lock.

    I can''t establish a connection.



    274

    00:23:43,146
    --> 00:23:45,614

    I''m running a diagnostic.



    275

    00:23:50,306
    --> 00:23:52,376

    - Incoming wormhole.

    - Close the iris.



    276

    00:23:58,146
    --> 00:23:59,738

    Oh, crap.



    277

    00:23:59,826 --> 00:24:04,695

    There
    is nothing wrong on our end.

    We should have been able to dial out.



    278

    00:24:14,426
    --> 00:24:17,384

    I''m sorry, but that just

    happens to be how I feel
    about it.



    279

    00:24:17,466 --> 00:24:19,855

    What do you think?



    280

    00:24:21,266
    --> 00:24:23,541

    Ask me tomorrow.



    281

    00:24:35,346 --> 00:24:38,179

    Recognising
    symbols on a keyboard

    won''t run a computer.



    282

    00:24:38,266
    --> 00:24:40,302

    We''ve been over this!



    283

    00:24:41,466 -->
    00:24:44,856

    I''m tellin'' you,

    the only way to stop this loop...



    284

    00:24:46,026
    --> 00:24:48,540

    ..is to figure out how to run that stuff!



    285

    00:24:50,586
    --> 00:24:54,101

    If we really have had this conversation,

    I probably
    pointed out...



    286

    00:24:54,186 --> 00:24:57,144

    ..there''s
    no way I can translate this

    in less than a day.



    287

    00:24:57,226
    --> 00:25:01,265

    Oh, I''m so ahead of you.

    I put the whole thing on
    tape last time.



    288

    00:25:01,346 --> 00:25:03,382

    So you don''t
    have to start from scratch.



    289

    00:25:11,586 --> 00:25:13,656

    If
    what you say is true,...



    290

    00:25:13,746 --> 00:25:18,866

    ..when
    the loop started again your

    recording wouldn''t have happened... yet.



    291

    00:25:21,226
    --> 00:25:24,616

    - Right.

    - Did I not say that?



    292

    00:25:24,706
    --> 00:25:27,061

    Careful! Be careful.



    293

    00:25:28,666 --> 00:25:32,136

    What
    about notes? lndelible ink?



    294

    00:25:36,546 --> 00:25:39,618

    If
    you are the only ones

    with memories of previous loops,...



    295

    00:25:39,706
    --> 00:25:43,699

    ..you''re gonna have to help me

    by learning and remembering.



    296

    00:25:47,706
    --> 00:25:49,776

    Fine.



    297

    00:25:49,866 --> 00:25:52,255

    How
    hard can it be?



    298

    00:26:00,026 --> 00:26:04,816

    According
    to Colonel O''Neill, we tried

    to block the connection to P4X-639...



    299

    00:26:04,906
    --> 00:26:06,897

    ..but were unable to dial out.



    300

    00:26:06,986
    --> 00:26:12,538

    I think that the Earth has become out of

    sync with
    the rest of the gate system,...



    301

    00:26:12,626 --> 00:26:15,379

    ..making
    it impossible for us

    to establish contact.



    302

    00:26:15,666
    --> 00:26:17,782

    What about SG-12?

    They managed to gate in.



    303

    00:26:17,866
    --> 00:26:21,336

    I realise that. So we ran

    a sequence of random diallings,...



    304

    00:26:21,426
    --> 00:26:23,986

    ..and this is what we found.



    305

    00:26:24,066
    --> 00:26:27,058

    These worlds we were able

    to contact, including Alaris,...



    306

    00:26:27,146
    --> 00:26:29,216

    ..where SG-12 was doing its survey.



    307

    00:26:29,306
    --> 00:26:32,935

    But the centre of this group is P4X-639.



    308

    00:26:33,026
    --> 00:26:37,622

    I believe the alien device is establishing

    simultaneous
    connection to these gates,...



    309

    00:26:37,706 --> 00:26:40,459

    ..creating
    a kind of... subspace bubble.



    310

    00:26:40,546 --> 00:26:44,255

    And
    everything within the bubble

    is cut off from the normal flow of time.



    311

    00:26:44,346
    --> 00:26:46,416

    What are the implications of this?



    312

    00:26:46,506
    --> 00:26:50,818

    We could relive the same day thousands

    of times, and
    we''d never know it.



    313

    00:26:51,786 --> 00:26:54,300

    - What
    can we do?

    - Unfortunately, not much.



    314

    00:26:54,546 --> 00:26:58,698

    The
    next time the loop starts we won''t

    even remember we had this conversation.



    315

    00:26:58,786
    --> 00:27:01,425

    It''s up to Teal''c and Colonel O''Neill.



    316

    00:27:03,826
    --> 00:27:05,817

    ''''Poteramus.''''



    317

    00:27:05,906 --> 00:27:08,579

    ''''Poteras...
    potarat.''''



    318

    00:27:09,826 --> 00:27:13,614

    ''''Crem... eras...
    cret... cremus.''''



    319

    00:27:20,826 --> 00:27:23,499

    This is
    a bad idea.



    320

    00:27:23,906 --> 00:27:26,101

    It would appear
    we have no choice.



    321

    00:27:26,666 --> 00:27:28,861

    (alarm)



    322

    00:27:30,906
    --> 00:27:33,784

    (PA) Unscheduled offworld activation.



    323

    00:27:33,866
    --> 00:27:36,539

    You know the worst part about this?



    324

    00:27:37,106
    --> 00:27:40,576

    Every time we loop,

    Daniel asks me a question, and...



    325

    00:27:41,586
    --> 00:27:43,861

    ..l wasn''t listening the first time.



    326

    00:27:43,946
    --> 00:27:46,938

    You are not the only one who

    must endure some discomfort.



    327

    00:27:48,106
    --> 00:27:50,859

    Sorry, sir. I didn''t realise you were there.



    328

    00:27:52,026
    --> 00:27:54,620

    - You have said that on many occasions.

    - I...



    329

    00:27:54,706
    --> 00:27:57,698

    Perhaps next time

    I will not be so forgiving.



    330

    00:28:00,266
    --> 00:28:03,622

    Section 23 ends with

    a reference to ''''perennial
    adventus''''.



    331

    00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:09,179

    - We''ve been
    over this.

    - It means ''''the approaching disaster''''.



    332

    00:28:12,706
    --> 00:28:15,857

    ''''Of the machine itself,

    with recurring use...



    333

    00:28:15,946
    --> 00:28:20,178

    ..the machine... surrenders

    to the rigours of time.''''



    334

    00:28:20,626
    --> 00:28:22,981

    That is incorrect, Daniel Jackson.



    335

    00:28:24,546
    --> 00:28:28,824

    The word ''''abicierum'''' means

    ''''to give up'''',
    not ''''surrender''''.



    336

    00:28:30,546 --> 00:28:35,540

    OK,
    this section of the text seems to deal

    primarily with their arrival on P4X-639.



    337

    00:28:35,906
    --> 00:28:40,377

    OK, this section of the text seems to deal

    primarily
    with their arrival on P4X-639.



    338

    00:28:40,466 --> 00:28:44,618

    Now
    this word here, ''''deductavum'''',

    is a variation of ''''deductum''''.



    339

    00:28:45,066
    --> 00:28:49,457

    OK, this section of the text seems to deal

    primarily
    with their arrival on P4X-639.



    340

    00:28:49,826 --> 00:28:54,183

    This
    appears to be a reference to

    the gradual degeneration of the machine.



    341

    00:28:54,706
    --> 00:28:57,095

    ..foundation of a colony.



    342

    00:29:02,386
    --> 00:29:05,856

    - Guys? This is important.

    - (PA) Unscheduled offworld
    activation.



    343

    00:29:09,866 --> 00:29:14,656

    O''Neill... Should
    we not be assisting

    Daniel Jackson with the translation?



    344

    00:29:15,506
    --> 00:29:17,781

    I''m taking this loop off.



    345

    00:29:23,986
    --> 00:29:26,546

    I''m tellin'' you, Teal''c.



    346

    00:29:26,626
    --> 00:29:29,743

    If we don''t find a way out of this soon,

    I''m gonna
    lose it.



    347

    00:29:31,946 --> 00:29:35,256

    Lose it. It means
    ''''go crazy''''.



    348

    00:29:36,626 --> 00:29:39,299

    Nuts. Insane.



    349

    00:29:39,386
    --> 00:29:42,935

    Bonzo. No longer in possession

    of one''s faculties.



    350

    00:29:43,026
    --> 00:29:45,586

    Three fries short of a Happy Meal.



    351

    00:29:45,666
    --> 00:29:47,019

    Wacko!



    352

    00:29:57,666 --> 00:29:59,657

    Teal''c.



    353

    00:30:00,986
    --> 00:30:04,422

    - Thank you, O''Neill.

    - No, no. Thank you, Teal''c.



    354

    00:30:08,826
    --> 00:30:11,021

    Oh, God!



    355

    00:30:12,946 --> 00:30:16,939

    Exactly
    how many of these loops

    have you... have we been through?



    356

    00:30:18,266
    --> 00:30:20,336

    I''ve lost track.



    357

    00:30:20,946 --> 00:30:24,461

    -
    That must be frustrating.

    - Uh... Yeah.



    358

    00:30:24,786 -->
    00:30:27,698

    On the other hand,

    it is kind of an opportunity.



    359

    00:30:28,506
    --> 00:30:30,576

    - How''s that?

    - Well, think about it.



    360

    00:30:30,666
    --> 00:30:36,024

    If you know in advance that everything

    is going to
    go back to the way it was,...



    361

    00:30:36,106 --> 00:30:38,574

    ..you
    could do anything

    for as long as you want...



    362

    00:30:38,666
    --> 00:30:42,261

    ..without having to

    worry about consequences.



    363

    00:30:52,746
    --> 00:30:55,101

    Excuse me.



    364

    00:31:09,946 --> 00:31:12,938

    -
    (alarm blaring)

    - (bicycle bell ringing)



    365

    00:31:14,346 -->
    00:31:18,021

    - Vern, how''s the wife?

    - Fine... sir.



    366

    00:31:21,306
    --> 00:31:23,297

    Oh, yeah!



    367

    00:31:23,986 --> 00:31:26,181

    That''ll
    play.



    368

    00:31:27,546 --> 00:31:30,014

    How far is Alaris, anyway?



    369

    00:31:30,106
    --> 00:31:32,176

    Several billion miles, O''Neill.



    370

    00:31:32,266
    --> 00:31:34,461

    That''s gotta be a record.



    371

    00:31:52,106
    --> 00:31:54,939

    (Hammond) Colonel O''Neill,

    what the hell are you
    doing?



    372

    00:31:55,026 --> 00:31:57,665

    In the middle of my
    backswing?!



    373

    00:31:58,546 --> 00:32:00,935

    Sorry, sir. I
    didn''t realise...



    374

    00:32:06,266 --> 00:32:08,575

    Excuse
    me, George.



    375

    00:32:08,666 --> 00:32:10,861

    Colonel, what
    are you

    doing out of uniform?



    376

    00:32:10,946 --> 00:32:14,734

    -
    Handing you my resignation.

    - Resigning? What for?



    377

    00:32:14,826
    --> 00:32:17,215

    So I can do... this.



    378

    00:32:25,226 --> 00:32:27,581

    What
    are you smiling at?



    379

    00:32:29,226 --> 00:32:31,421

    Nothin''.



    380

    00:32:40,346
    --> 00:32:45,022

    - What have you got for us, Dr Jackson?

    - Uh, with
    the help of Teal''c and Jack,...



    381

    00:32:45,426 --> 00:32:47,986

    ..l''ve
    managed

    to complete the translation.



    382

    00:32:48,066 --> 00:32:52,662

    As
    I originally suspected, P4X-639

    was once a colony of the Ancients.



    383

    00:32:52,746
    --> 00:32:57,137

    They thrived there until they were

    struck with some
    sort of cataclysm,...



    384

    00:32:57,226 --> 00:32:59,456

    ..perhaps
    a disease.



    385

    00:32:59,746 --> 00:33:03,819

    In any case, facing
    certain destruction,

    they built the time machine.



    386

    00:33:03,906
    --> 00:33:07,137

    To go back and change their history

    to avoid their
    fate.



    387

    00:33:07,346 --> 00:33:09,257

    Right. But it didn''t
    work.



    388

    00:33:09,346 --> 00:33:12,656

    Instead of sending a
    team of scientists

    back to the key moment,...



    389

    00:33:12,746
    --> 00:33:17,456

    ..the device caused a continuous loop,

    like the one
    we''ve been experiencing.



    390

    00:33:17,546 --> 00:33:22,336

    They
    experienced it hundreds of times

    trying to get the machine to work, but...



    391

    00:33:23,306
    --> 00:33:26,855

    They gave up. They shut it down

    and let the end come.



    392

    00:33:27,706
    --> 00:33:29,981

    So the loop can be broken.



    393

    00:33:30,066
    --> 00:33:32,819

    Uh, there''s a section of text on the altar...



    394

    00:33:32,906
    --> 00:33:36,421

    ..that deals with the geomagnetic storms

    that power
    the device.



    395

    00:33:36,506 --> 00:33:39,976

    They recur every
    50 or so years,

    which is why, incidentally, the...



    396

    00:33:40,066
    --> 00:33:41,545

    Yes, sir.



    397

    00:33:42,866 --> 00:33:45,096

    The
    loop can be broken.



    398

    00:33:45,466 --> 00:33:48,060

    I was
    getting to that.



    399

    00:33:48,146 --> 00:33:52,776

    When we activate
    the symbols in the right

    sequence, I think we can shut it down.



    400

    00:33:53,306
    --> 00:33:56,742

    Colonel, have your team geared up

    and ready to embark
    in 30 minutes.



    401

    00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:58,578

    Yes, sir.



    402

    00:34:06,066
    --> 00:34:10,218

    A geomagnetic storm is building up.

    We shouldn''t
    stay long.



    403

    00:34:10,306 --> 00:34:11,739

    Lucky guess.



    404

    00:34:15,586
    --> 00:34:18,783

    - Malikai?

    - I don''t see anyone, sir.



    405

    00:34:20,106
    --> 00:34:23,621

    He''s around here somewhere.

    He knows we''re onto
    him.



    406

    00:34:33,786 --> 00:34:35,777

    Teal''c?



    407

    00:34:40,626
    --> 00:34:43,743

    I''m sorry, but you''ve come

    to break the time loop.



    408

    00:34:43,826
    --> 00:34:46,977

    And I''m afraid I can''t let you do that.



    409

    00:34:56,746
    --> 00:34:59,214

    Get away from that thing.



    410

    00:35:10,906
    --> 00:35:13,864

    Sir, it looks like a variation

    of a Goa''uld force
    shield.



    411

    00:35:13,946 --> 00:35:18,098

    It is, Major. I had
    to trade several

    rare artefacts for the field generator,...



    412

    00:35:18,186
    --> 00:35:20,336

    ..but it was well worth it.



    413

    00:35:21,106
    --> 00:35:26,180

    Malikai? We have to reset those controls

    or the loop''s
    gonna start all over again.



    414

    00:35:26,266 --> 00:35:29,736

    I''m
    counting on it. I need more time.



    415

    00:35:30,346 --> 00:35:34,134

    Once
    I''ve deciphered the symbols,

    I will be able to master the time device.



    416

    00:35:34,346
    --> 00:35:36,735

    Why? So you can be

    king of Groundhog Day?



    417

    00:35:36,826
    --> 00:35:40,296

    Do you think I would do this

    for personal power?



    418

    00:35:40,386
    --> 00:35:42,581

    She...



    419

    00:35:44,786 --> 00:35:47,937

    -
    You wouldn''t understand.

    - What happened?



    420

    00:35:53,466
    --> 00:35:58,984

    She died. 12 years ago. When I found

    this place and
    discovered its purpose,...



    421

    00:35:59,066 --> 00:36:02,775

    ..l
    dedicated myself

    to unlocking its mysteries.



    422

    00:36:02,866
    --> 00:36:05,255

    (Carter) So you could

    go back and save her.



    423

    00:36:05,346
    --> 00:36:09,578

    No, that would be quite impossible. She

    died from
    a congenital heart weakness.



    424

    00:36:09,906 --> 00:36:13,342

    Not
    even the ability to travel time

    could change that.



    425

    00:36:13,426
    --> 00:36:15,986

    Then why are you doing this?



    426

    00:36:16,426
    --> 00:36:18,894

    To be with her once more.



    427

    00:36:20,466
    --> 00:36:23,458

    Malikai, the device doesn''t work.



    428

    00:36:24,266
    --> 00:36:27,224

    - It never did.

    - It never did?



    429

    00:36:28,946
    --> 00:36:32,655

    - You''re living proof.

    - We translated the text on
    the ruins.



    430

    00:36:32,746 --> 00:36:36,295

    The Ancients who
    built this place

    never got it to work.



    431

    00:36:36,386 -->
    00:36:40,584

    They tried over and over again,

    just like you, but in
    the end they gave up.



    432

    00:36:40,666 --> 00:36:44,864

    Why
    do you think this place is deserted?

    They couldn''t save themselves.



    433

    00:36:45,506
    --> 00:36:49,624

    You''re wrong. There must be some other

    explanation.
    I know I can make this work.



    434

    00:36:49,706 --> 00:36:54,382

    You
    can''t! They proved it can''t be done.

    You''re just gonna go on like this
    for ever.



    435

    00:36:54,466 --> 00:36:57,742

    - You''ll be trapped.

    -
    Along with billions of innocent others.



    436

    00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:02,095

    This
    device activates

    14 Stargates simultaneously.



    437

    00:37:02,186
    --> 00:37:05,701

    That''s 14 worlds reliving

    the same day over and over.



    438

    00:37:08,266
    --> 00:37:12,100

    I, uh... I didn''t realise.



    439

    00:37:12,186
    --> 00:37:14,177

    (high-pitched sound)



    440

    00:37:15,266 --> 00:37:20,784

    But
    once I am able to input the correct

    time coordinates, the loop will be broken.



    441

    00:37:20,866
    --> 00:37:24,302

    The people who made that machine

    made the Stargates,...



    442

    00:37:24,386
    --> 00:37:26,900

    ..and they couldn''t get

    the damn thing to work.



    443

    00:37:26,986
    --> 00:37:30,581

    And even if you could,

    just for the sake of argument,...



    444

    00:37:31,506
    --> 00:37:34,498

    ..you can''t change what happened to her.



    445

    00:37:34,586
    --> 00:37:37,737

    I can... touch her face again.



    446

    00:37:38,706
    --> 00:37:41,778

    Talk with her. Hear her laugh.



    447

    00:37:41,866
    --> 00:37:43,777

    - Like you remember?

    - Yes.



    448

    00:37:43,866
    --> 00:37:46,141

    Then what''ll happen?



    449

    00:37:47,146 -->
    00:37:49,535

    - She''ll die.

    - And then what?



    450

    00:37:50,306
    --> 00:37:52,183

    You start over?



    451

    00:37:57,826 --> 00:38:00,181

    Listen
    to me.



    452

    00:38:00,666 --> 00:38:02,941

    - I know what it''s
    like.

    - You can''t!



    453

    00:38:03,106 --> 00:38:06,018

    I
    lost my son! I know!



    454

    00:38:11,466 --> 00:38:13,855

    And as
    much as l...



    455

    00:38:16,426 --> 00:38:19,020

    I could never
    live that over again.



    456

    00:38:22,946 --> 00:38:24,777

    Could
    you?



    457

    00:38:34,706 --> 00:38:36,025

    No.



    458

    00:38:39,266
    --> 00:38:41,655

    Let her go.



    459

    00:39:53,026 --> 00:39:56,985

    Well,
    we''re still here, Colonel.

    I assume you were successful.



    460

    00:39:57,106
    --> 00:39:59,700

    Well, General, you know what they say.



    461

    00:39:59,786
    --> 00:40:02,061

    If at first you don''t succeed,...



    462

    00:40:02,666
    --> 00:40:05,658

    ..try, try, try...



    463

    00:40:05,746 --> 00:40:08,135

    ..try,
    try... try again.



    464

    00:40:16,986 --> 00:40:20,023

    I don''t
    think I''ve ever seen

    anyone enjoy oatmeal so much.



    465

    00:40:20,106
    --> 00:40:25,226

    When you''ve eaten Froot Loops for who

    knows how long...
    a little variety helps.



    466

    00:40:25,306 --> 00:40:30,744

    We
    heard from the Tok''ra. They''ve been

    trying to contact us for over three
    months.



    467

    00:40:31,426 --> 00:40:32,336

    Really?



    468

    00:40:32,426
    --> 00:40:34,656

    Who knows when they realised

    we were cut off.



    469

    00:40:34,746
    --> 00:40:37,419

    I mean, there''s no telling

    how much time passed.



    470

    00:40:37,506
    --> 00:40:42,022

    Let me ask you something.

    In all the time you were,
    um, looping,...



    471

    00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:45,576

    ..were you
    ever tempted

    to, um, do something crazy?



    472

    00:40:46,026 -->
    00:40:51,419

    I mean, uh... You could do anything

    without worrying about
    consequences.



    473

    00:40:54,946 --> 00:40:57,460

    You know, it''s
    funny.

    You''ve asked me that before.



    474

    00:40:58,226 --> 00:41:00,217

    And?



    475

    00:41:57,666
    --> 00:41:59,736
